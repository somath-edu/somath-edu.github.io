## Entropy Increases Again

No matter how perfectly a room is organized, it becomes messy again after just one day of living in it. The same applies to the knowledge within our brains.

**Entropy naturally increases over time.** This is the law of nature.

> **The Law of Entropy**
> * A desk cleaned today → will be messy again tomorrow
> * Words memorized today → will fade tomorrow
> * Notes organized today → will become unclear over time

![The Law of Entropy](/images/IMG_2381.webp)

Therefore, we must have a system that periodically cleans up the disorder that accumulates little by little each day – in other words, a **'Routine.'**

> **What is a Routine?**<br>
> It is an **'entropy shield'** that minimizes energy consumption by allowing the brain to act without deliberation.

## 1. The Brain's Golden Time

Not all time is equal. The brain's energy fluctuates throughout the day.

To efficiently control entropy, you must allocate the most challenging tasks to **'your brain's clearest time (Golden Time).'**

---

### Differences in Time Density

> **Qualitative Differences in Time**<br>
> One hour at 11 PM when you're sleepy and exhausted, and one hour at 10 AM after a good night's sleep, are **qualitatively different.**

Many students try to do their most important self-directed learning during **'leftover time'** after expending all their energy at school and cram academies.

This is the **epitome of inefficiency**, attempting forced input in a high-entropy state.

#### Brain Energy Curve Throughout the Day

### Energy Matching Strategy

> **Study Allocation Strategy by Time Slot**

#### High-Intensity Time (Morning/Early Evening)

**When the brain is most active**: 9 AM to 12 PM, 7 PM to 9 PM

**Tasks to allocate**:
- Solving math problems (logical thinking)
- Non-fiction reading comprehension (requires concentration)
- Learning new concepts
- Tackling difficult problems
- **The most disliked and challenging studies**

> **Utilizing High-Intensity Time**<br>
> "As soon as I wake up in the morning, I solve the 3 most difficult math problems. My mind is clearest at this time."

---

#### Medium-Intensity Time (Mid-Afternoon/Mid-Evening)

**When the brain is stable**: 4 PM to 6 PM, 9 PM to 10 PM

**Tasks to allocate**:
- English reading comprehension
- Review and organization
- Workbook problem-solving
- Concept memorization

---

#### Low-Intensity Time (Post-meal Drowsiness/Before Sleep)

**When energy levels are low**: 1 PM to 3 PM, after 10 PM

**Tasks to allocate**:
- Simple memorization (English vocabulary, dates)
- Organizing incorrect answer notes
- Listening comprehension
- Light review
- **Mechanical or low-burden studies**

> **Caution for Low-Intensity Time**<<br>
> Trying to learn new concepts during this time won't stick in your mind. It's wiser to do light review or organization.

### Finding Your Own Golden Time

![Finding Your Own Golden Time](/images/IMG_2387.webp)

> **Individual Differences Exist**<br>
> Each person has a different golden time. Study at various times for two weeks and find the time that suits you best.

<br>
<hr>
<br>

## 2. Redefining Rest

> **The Essence of Rest**<br>
> "Rest time is not merely time away from studying, but time to consolidate what you've studied in your brain."

Just as a computer generates heat and slows down if left on continuously, the brain also generates heat (entropy) if it processes information continuously.

If this heat is not cooled, burnout will occur.

> **Redefining Rest**<br>
> Rest is not laziness, but a **'strategic cooling time'** to reduce entropy.

---

### 1. The Science of Zoning Out: Default Mode Network

> **The Truth About Zoning Out**<br>
> When you do nothing and zone out, your brain isn't resting; it's performing the **task of classifying and storing recently acquired information.**

#### How the Brain Truly Rests

![How the Brain Truly Rests](/images/IMG_2383.webp)

> **Metaphor for Brain Organization**<br>
> Continuously inputting information without rest is like **constantly throwing package boxes into a warehouse without giving any time to sort them.**

#### How to Practice Zoning Out

**Pomodoro + Zoning Out Combination**:
1. 50 minutes of focused study
2. 10 minutes of **complete zoning out**
3. If you look at your smartphone during this time, your brain has not rested.

> **10-Minute Zoning Out Guide**
> * Sit comfortably in a chair
> * Close your eyes or look out the window
> * Don't try to think of nothing
> * Just let your thoughts flow
> * When the timer rings, start studying again

---

### 2. Sleep: The Best Entropy Cleaner

> **The Importance of Sleep**<br>
> While you sleep, cerebrospinal fluid washes away waste products (such as beta-amyloid) accumulated in the brain.

> **Sleep vs. Study Time**<br>
> Reducing sleep time to study is like **continuously piling things in an uncleaned garbage dump.**

#### Optimal Sleep Duration

![Optimal Sleep Duration](/images/IMG_2384.webp)

| Age | Recommended Sleep | Minimum Sleep |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Elementary School Students | 9~11 hours | 8 hours |
| Middle School Students | 8~10 hours | 7 hours |
| High School Students | 7~9 hours | 6 hours |

> **Non-Negotiable Condition**<br>
> A minimum of **6-7 hours of sleep** is a non-negotiable condition for the brain's order.

#### Improving Sleep Quality

**1 hour before sleep**:
- [ ] Turn off smartphone (blue light blocking)
- [ ] Turn off bright lights
- [ ] Avoid strenuous exercise
- [ ] No caffeine intake
- [ ] A glass of lukewarm water

**Sleeping environment**:
- [ ] Dark (blackout curtains)
- [ ] Cool (18~20°C)
- [ ] Quiet (consider earplugs)
- [ ] Comfortable (adjust pillow height)

## 3. The Power of Habit

Deciding "I must study" every day is itself a great stress (load) on the brain.

This is because energy is consumed in the process of making a decision.

> **Ultimate Goal**<br>
> **"Sitting at your desk without needing to decide."**

---

### 1. Creating a Start Routine: Setting a Trigger

Create a small signal that tells your brain, "It's time to study now."

#### Start Routine Example

![Start Routine Example](/images/IMG_2386.webp)

> **The Power of Conditioned Reflex**<br>
> If you repeat this process, eventually, **just by turning on the light,** your brain will automatically switch to focus mode. <br>
> This is an entropy reduction technique utilizing conditioned reflex.

---

#### Various Start Routines

![Various Start Routines](/images/IMG_2389.webp)

> **Real Case**<br>
> "Every day, as soon as I sit at my desk, I drink a glass of water. Now, just drinking water automatically puts me into focus mode."

---

### 2. Repetition of Small Successes

> **The Trap of Grand Plans**<br>
> Grand plans lead to failure, and failure breeds disorder (giving up).

#### Starting Small

* ❌ **Failing Plan**: “Starting tomorrow, I'll study for 3 hours every day!” → Gives up in 3 days
* ✅ **Successful Plan**: “Starting tomorrow, I'll memorize 5 words every day.” → Small but daily success → Confidence ↑

#### Habit Building Stages

![Habit Building Stages](/images/IMG_2391.webp)

> **The Power of Achievement**<br>
> When one experiences the pleasure that comes from an orderly life, the brain itself tries to maintain that order.

---

### 3. Consistency: Same Time, Same Place, Same Order

> **3 Elements of Routine**
> 1. **Same Time**: 7 PM every day
> 2. **Same Place**: Desk
> 3. **Same Order**: Water → Light → Deep breath → Start

#### The Power of Consistency
