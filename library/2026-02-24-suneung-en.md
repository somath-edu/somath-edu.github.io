title: "From Search to Answer: How Generative AI Is Redefining the Knowledge Ecosystem"

The most prominent topic in the current IT industry is undoubtedly the "paradigm shift in the search market." For the past two decades, the way humanity consumes information has remained within the framework of "keyword searches" and "link clicks," represented by Google. However, with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, announcing "SearchGPT" and the rapid growth of AI-specialized search engines like Perplexity, the initiative in information seeking is rapidly shifting from "searching" to "answering."

Conventional search methods functioned by listing web pages with high relevance to the keywords entered by the user. In this traditional model, the user was an active agent who had to click on various links, filter through the provided information, and summarize it themselves. In contrast, generative AI-based search utilizes "Retrieval-Augmented Generation" (RAG) technology. This system navigates vast amounts of data in real-time, extracts only reliable information, and generates complete, descriptive answers to the user's questions. Consequently, users no longer need to wander through multiple websites to assemble information.

While this technological advancement maximizes convenience, it simultaneously creates severe tension within the information ecosystem. The most critical issue is the intensification of the "zero-click" phenomenon. As AI provides comprehensive summaries, users no longer visit the source sites—such as news outlets or blogs—where the original content resides. This leads to a decline in advertising revenue for content creators, which raises concerns that it may eventually lead to a "depletion of information" where high-quality content is no longer produced. The reason global platforms are currently rushing into copyright negotiations with news organizations can be seen as a desperate measure to prevent this ecological collapse.

Furthermore, we must pay attention to the changes occurring from a cognitive perspective. The habit of accepting a single, refined "correct answer" provided by AI poses a significant risk of hindering the multifaceted examination of knowledge. If an AI’s response, positioned at the top of search results, is biased or contains false information due to "hallucinations," users are highly likely to accept it without critical evaluation. This is a grave problem that could undermine "information diversity," which serves as the foundation of a democratic society.

Students should not view this phenomenon merely as a technological advancement; it suggests that the very definition of reading comprehension is changing. If reading in the past was the ability to "find" core points within scattered information, literacy in the AI era is transitioning into the ability to "verify the authenticity and logic" of the information processed by AI. In an age where technology provides the answers, we must sharpen our ability to ask questions and our critical thinking skills to doubt those answers. What should replace the disappearing search bar is not the omnipotence of AI, but rather the highly evolved literacy of human beings.
