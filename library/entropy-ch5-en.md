> **Core Principle**<br>
> "Don't trust willpower. Trust the environment."

## 1. Willpower is a Consumable Resource

Many parents and students resolve to "focus and study hard." However, from a neuroscience perspective, **willpower is a resource that depletes like a battery**.

A child exhausted from school and academies all day will have almost no willpower left by 10 PM. This isn't because of "weak mental strength," but because the brain's energy has been depleted.

> **The Core of Entropy Learning Method**<br>
> It is a **'system'** that makes studying happen naturally, even without willpower.<br>
> The easiest and fastest way to build such a system is through **'environmental control'**.

By lowering the entropy of the environment (establishing order), the brain can fully dedicate its energy to studying.

## 2. Digital Detox and Environmental Control: The Law of 'Friction'

Smartphones, game consoles, beds... overcoming these high-entropy elements that interfere with studying by willpower alone is nearly impossible.

Here, we must introduce the concept of **'Friction'** from behavioral economics.

### Principle of Friction

> **Key to Friction Design**
> * **High friction for bad habits (distractions)**: Make the process of turning on your smartphone cumbersome and difficult.
> * **Low friction for good habits (studying)**: Make the process of opening a book as natural as breathing.

| Habit | Friction Design | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Checking Smartphone** | Keep in another room, turn off power | Access barrier ↑ |
| **Sitting at Desk** | Open book in advance, prepare pen | Starting resistance ↓ |

### [Practical] Digital Entropy Removal Guidelines

#### 1. Physical Isolation: Out of sight, out of mind

> **The Most Powerful Distraction**<br>
> "A smartphone placed next to the desk"

When studying, your smartphone should be placed **out of sight**.

![스마트폰 격리](/images/IMG_2333.webp)

**Practice Methods**:
- Place it in the living room or kitchen
- Turn it off completely and put it deep inside a drawer
- Remove the charger from the study room as well
- Entrust it to your parents

> **Example of Maximizing Friction**<br>
> **Before**: Smartphone on the desk → Check immediately when a notification appears (Friction 0)<br>
> **After**: Stored in a living room drawer with power off → To check, must stand up, walk to it, and turn it on (Friction maximized)

---

#### 2. The Silence of Notifications: Even Vibration Kidnaps the Brain

If you use a study tablet, turn off all SNS and game notifications or constantly activate **'Do Not Disturb mode'**.

> **The Danger of Vibration**<br>
> Even the sound of vibration is a powerful entropy that hijacks the brain's attention.

**Setting Checklist**:
- [ ] Turn off all app notifications
- [ ] Activate Do Not Disturb mode
- [ ] Allow calls/texts only (for emergencies)
- [ ] Turn off vibration as well

---

#### 3. Make Logging Out a Habit: Small Inconvenience Blocks the Unconscious

Disable auto-login for YouTube or SNS so you **have to log in every time you want to use them**.

That small inconvenience prevents unconscious access.

> **Additional Tips**
> * Delete apps and access only via web browser
> * Set complex passwords to require input every time
> * Hide apps deep within folders

## 3. Prepared Environment: Eliminating Visual Noise and 'Zero Base'

The moment you sit at your desk and start rummaging through a pile of books, muttering, "Let's see, where's my math book?", your brain's concentration mode is broken.

![정돈된 책상](/images/IMG_2336.webp)

**The longer the preparation process before starting to study, the higher the entry barrier (entropy) becomes.**

> **The Ideal Desk**<br>
> Your desk should be a **'launchpad where studying begins in 1 second the moment you sit down'**.

---

### [Desk Setup Methods for Immersion]

#### 1. Blocking Visual Noise

A person's field of vision is about 120 degrees. When studying, nothing should be within your line of sight except for **'the book you are currently studying and writing instruments'**.

**Removal Targets**:
- Cute figurines
- Unfinished comic books
- Items to take tomorrow
- Snack bags
- Textbooks for other subjects

> **Before & After**<br>
> **Before**: 5 workbooks, smartphone, figurines, snacks, water bottle on the desk...<br>
> **After**: Only 1 math workbook for current use, 1 pen, 1 notebook

---

#### 2. Zero-Base Organization Method

> **Core Concept**<br>
> The key is not to clean your desk after studying, but to **'set it up for the next study session'** before you get up.

**Practice Methods**:

1. **When today's study session ends**
   - Clear the desk completely

2. **Set up for tomorrow's study**
   - If you plan to study math tomorrow
   - Open the math book
   - Place a pen on top of it
   - Go to bed

3. **The next morning**
   - When you sit at your desk
   - Without the brain pondering (What should I do?)
   - Start studying immediately

> **Effects of Zero Base**
> * Reduced start time: 10 minutes → 10 seconds
> * Eliminated decision fatigue: No pondering what to do
> * Reduced psychological resistance: Already prepared state

---

#### 3. Structuring Movement Paths

> **Principles of Movement Path Design**
> * **Frequently used items close by**
> * **Seldom used items far away**

**Practice Example**:

| Item | Location | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Water bottle | Right next to the desk | Temptation of TV if going to the living room |
| Eraser | Pen holder | So it can be taken out immediately |
| Supplementary notebook | Top drawer | Only when needed |
| Books for other subjects | Bookshelf | Out of sight |

> **Case Study: Movement Path Optimization**<br>
> **Problem Situation**: Went to the living room for water and fell into the temptation of TV<br>
> **Solution**: Prepare a water bottle next to the desk in advance

## 4. The Power of Single-Tasking: One Thing at a Time, Protect Your Brain's Energy

Once the environment is tidy, the question is now **how to use your brain in that space**.

![싱글 태스킹](/images/IMG_2337.webp)

As mentioned in Chapter 2, multitasking is a primary cause of entropy explosion. Now, you must switch to **'Single-tasking'**.

---

### 1. Spotlight Effect

> **Spotlight Principle**<br>
> Just as a stage light illuminates only one protagonist, focus on only one subject, one workbook, and one problem at a time.

**Single-Tasking Practice Methods**:
- Only one subject at a time
- Only one workbook at a time
- Only one problem at a time

| Multitasking (High Entropy) | Single-Tasking (Low Entropy) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Doing math, then English, then Korean | Focus on math for 2 hours → Finish completely → Start English |
| 3 workbooks simultaneously | Master 1 workbook perfectly |
| Studying while listening to music | Complete silence or white noise |

---

### 2. Using a Timer: Pomodoro Technique

> **Pomodoro Technique**<br>
> "For exactly 25 minutes, I will solve only these 5 math problems."

By limiting time and goals, the brain discards distractions and immerses itself only in that goal.

**Basic Method**:
1. Set timer for 25 minutes
2. Focus on a single task
3. 5-minute break after 25 minutes
4. 20-minute long break after 4 sets

**Application Methods**:
- Adjust time according to concentration (15 min, 30 min, 50 min)
- Set goals by number of problems (e.g., 20 English words)
- Set goals by page count (e.g., 10 pages of a textbook)

> **Caution**<br>
> When the timer rings, you **must** take a break. If you don't rest, your brain will get tired, and the efficiency of the next set will decrease.

---

### 3. Reducing Switching Time

**Avoid frequent subject changes** such as doing Korean, then math, then English again.

> **Principle of Depth**<br>
> It is more advantageous for maintaining brain order to delve deeply into one subject (for at least 1-2 hours), then fully rest the brain during a break before moving on to the next subject.

**Efficient Subject Switching Methods**:

* ❌ **Inefficient (Frequent subject switching)**: 30 min math → 30 min English → 30 min Korean → math again (Significant energy loss during switching)
* ✅ **Efficient (Subject blocking)**: 90 min math focus → 15 min complete break → 90 min English focus (Minimized switching frequency)

**Checklist for Subject Switching**:
- [ ] Have you completely organized the previous subject?
- [ ] Have you rested enough? (5~15 minutes)
- [ ] Are you prepared for the next subject?
- [ ] Have you completely cleared your mind?
