> **Core Principle**<br>
> "Don't trust willpower. Trust your environment."

## 1. Willpower is a Consumable

Many parents and students resolve to "focus and study diligently." However, from a neuroscience perspective, **willpower is a resource that depletes like a battery.**

For a child exhausted from school and after-school academies all day, there is hardly any willpower left by 10 PM. This is not because of "weak mental fortitude," but because the brain's energy has been depleted.

> **Core of Entropy Learning**<br>
> It's about creating a **'system'** that allows studying to happen naturally, without relying on willpower.<br>
> The easiest and fastest way to build such a system is through **'environmental control.'**

By lowering the entropy of the environment (establishing order), the brain can fully dedicate its energy to studying.

## 2. Digital Detox and Environmental Control: The Law of 'Friction'

Smartphones, gaming consoles, beds... Overcoming these high-entropy elements that hinder studying by willpower alone is nearly impossible.

Here, we must introduce the concept of **'Friction'** from behavioral economics.

### Principle of Friction

> **Key to Friction Design**
> * **High friction for bad habits (distractions)**: Make the process of turning on your smartphone inconvenient and difficult.
> * **Low friction for good habits (studying)**: Make the process of opening a book as natural as breathing.

| Habit | Friction Design | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Checking smartphone** | Store in another room, turn off power | Access barrier ↑ |
| **Sitting at desk** | Open book beforehand, prepare pen | Starting resistance ↓ |

### [Practical] Digital Entropy Removal Rules

#### 1. Physical Isolation: Out of Sight, Out of Mind

> **The Most Powerful Distraction**<br>
> "Smartphone placed next to your desk"

When studying, your smartphone should be placed **out of your line of sight.**

![스마트폰 격리](/images/IMG_2333.webp)

**How to Practice**:
- Place it in the living room or kitchen
- Turn it off completely and put it deep inside a drawer
- Remove the charger from the study room
- Entrust it to your parents

> **Example of Maximizing Friction**<br>
> **Before**: Smartphone on desk → Immediate check when notification appears (Friction 0)<br>
> **After**: Stored in a living room drawer with power off → To check, you must get up, walk, and turn it on (Friction maximized)

---

#### 2. Silence of Notifications: Even Vibration Kidnaps the Brain

If you use a study tablet, turn off all SNS and game notifications, or keep **'Do Not Disturb Mode'** permanently active.

> **The Danger of Vibration**<br>
> Even the sound of vibration is a powerful entropy that hijacks the brain's attention.

**Settings Checklist**:
- [ ] Turn off all app notifications
- [ ] Activate Do Not Disturb mode
- [ ] Allow calls/texts only (for emergencies)
- [ ] Turn off vibration as well

---

#### 3. Make Logging Out a Habit: Small Inconveniences Prevent Unconscious Access

For YouTube or SNS, disable automatic login so you **have to log in every time you want to view them.**

That small inconvenience prevents unconscious access.

> **Additional Tips**
> * Delete apps and force access only through a web browser
> * Set a complex password to require input every time
> * Hide apps deep within folders

## 3. Prepared Environment: Visual Noise Removal and 'Zero Base'

The moment you sit down at your desk and start rummaging through a pile of books, thinking, "Let's see, where's my math book?", your brain's focus mode is broken.

![정돈된 책상](/images/IMG_2336.webp)

**The longer the preparation process before starting to study, the higher the entry barrier (entropy).**

> **The Ideal Desk**<br>
> Your desk should be a **'launchpad where studying begins in 1 second the moment you sit down.'**

---

### [Desk Setup for Immersion]

#### 1. Blocking Visual Noise

A person's field of vision is about 120 degrees. When studying, within the visible range in front of your eyes, there should be **nothing but 'the book you're currently studying and your writing tools.'**

**Items to Remove**:
- Cute figurines
- Unfinished comic books
- Supplies for tomorrow
- Snack bags
- Textbooks for other subjects

> **Before & After**<br>
> **Before**: 5 workbooks, smartphone, figurine, snacks, water bottle on the desk...<br>
> **After**: Only 1 math workbook for current use, 1 pen, 1 notebook.

---

#### 2. Zero-Base Organization Method

> **Core Concept**<br>
> The key is not to tidy up your desk *after* studying, but to **'set it up for the next study session'** *before* you get up.

**How to Practice**:

1. **When today's study session is over**
   - Clear the desk completely
   
2. **Set up for tomorrow's study**
   - If you plan to study math tomorrow
   - Open your math book
   - Place a pen on it
   - And go to bed

3. **The next morning**
   - When you sit at your desk
   - Without your brain wondering (What should I do?)
   - Immediately start studying

> **Effects of Zero-Base**
> * Reduced start time: 10 minutes → 10 seconds
> * Elimination of decision fatigue: No need to wonder what to do
> * Reduced psychological resistance: Already prepared state

---

#### 3. Structuring Workflow

> **Workflow Design Principles**
> * **Frequently used items close at hand**
> * **Occasionally used items further away**

**How to Practice**:

| Item | Location | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Water bottle | Right next to desk | TV temptation if going to living room |
| Eraser | Pen holder | To be able to take out immediately |
| Auxiliary notebook | First drawer | Only when needed |
| Other subject books | Bookshelf | Out of sight |

> **Workflow Optimization Case Study**<br>
> **Problem Situation**: Going to the living room for water and succumbing to the TV's temptation<br>
> **Solution**: Prepare a water bottle next to your desk beforehand

## 4. The Power of Single-Tasking: One Thing at a Time, Protect Your Brain's Energy

Once the environment is organized, the question becomes **how to use your brain in that space.**

![싱글 태스킹](/images/IMG_2337.webp)

As mentioned in Chapter 2, multitasking is a primary culprit for exploding entropy. Now, you must switch to **'single-tasking.'**

---

### 1. Spotlight Effect

> **Spotlight Principle**<br>
> Just as a spotlight on a stage illuminates only one protagonist, focus on only one subject, one workbook, and one problem at a time.

**How to Practice Single-Tasking**:
- Only one subject at a time
- Only one workbook at a time
- Only one problem at a time

| Multitasking (High Entropy) | Single-Tasking (Low Entropy) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Switching between math, English, and Korean | 2 hours focused on math → completely finish → start English |
| 3 workbooks simultaneously | Master 1 book completely |
| Studying while listening to music | Complete silence or white noise |

---

### 2. Using a Timer: Pomodoro Technique

> **Pomodoro Technique**<br>
> "For exactly 25 minutes, I will solve only these 5 math problems."

By limiting time and goals, the brain discards distractions and immerses itself only in that goal.

**Basic Method**:
1. Set a timer for 25 minutes
2. Focus on a single task
3. After 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break
4. After 4 sets, take a 20-minute long break

**Applied Methods**:
- Adjust time according to concentration (15 min, 30 min, 50 min)
- Set goals by number of problems (e.g., 20 English words)
- Set goals by number of pages (e.g., 10 textbook pages)

> **Caution**<br>
> When the timer rings, you **must** take a break. If you don't rest, your brain will get tired, reducing the efficiency of the next set.

---

### 3. Reducing Switching Time

**Avoid frequent subject changes**, such as doing Korean, then math, then English.

> **Principle of Depth**<br>
> It is beneficial for maintaining brain order to delve sufficiently deep into one subject (at least 1-2 hours), then fully rest the brain during a break before moving on to the next subject.

**Efficient Subject Switching Methods**:

* ❌ **Inefficient (Frequent subject switching)**: 30 min Math → 30 min English → 30 min Korean → back to Math (Significant energy loss during switching)
* ✅ **Efficient (Subject blocking)**: 90 min focused on Math → 15 min complete break → 90 min focused on English (Minimize switching frequency)


**Checklist for Subject Switching**:
- [ ] Have I completely wrapped up the previous subject?
- [ ] Have I rested sufficiently? (5-15 minutes)
- [ ] Am I prepared for the next subject?
- [ ] Have I completely cleared my mind?
