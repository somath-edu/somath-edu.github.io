Greetings, students! This is your lead instructor for English.

Recent trends in the CSAT non-fiction section focus on measuring **'convergent thinking,'** where methodologies from different academic fields collide or complement each other. Today, I have prepared a passage regarding **'Bayesianism,'** which attempts to resolve the problems of philosophical hypothesis testing through mathematical probability theory.

This passage explains how the 'hypothetico-deductive method' of logic meets the 'conditional probability' of statistics. Please follow along closely without missing the logical links between sentences. Now, let’s focus!

### [Passage: The Confirmation of Hypotheses and Bayesian Justification]

In traditional philosophy of science, great importance has been placed on the "hypothetico-deductive method," which posits that if a prediction $e$ derived from a hypothesis $H$ is proven true through observation, then the hypothesis $H$ is confirmed. For example, from the hypothesis "All ravens are black," one derives the prediction "The raven I see tomorrow will also be black," and witnessing an actual black raven increases the reliability of the hypothesis. However, this approach encounters a significant hurdle known as the "paradox of confirmation." The proposition "All ravens are black" is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, "All non-black things are not ravens." Consequently, according to the hypothetico-deductive method, even observing a piece of white chalk in a room becomes evidence that confirms the hypothesis "All ravens are black," leading to an counter-intuitive conclusion.

To overcome these limitations, "Bayesianism" emerged. Bayesians express a scientist's degree of belief in a certain hypothesis as a probability between 0 and 1, and they focus on how this probability is updated as new evidence is discovered. The centerpiece of this approach is "Bayes' Theorem." According to Bayes' Theorem, the "posterior probability" $P(H|e)$—the probability that hypothesis $H$ is true given evidence $e$—is proportional to the product of the "likelihood" $P(e|H)$, which is the probability that evidence $e$ would appear under the assumption that $H$ is true, and the "prior probability" $P(H)$ of the hypothesis.

From a Bayesian perspective, confirmation refers to the process where the posterior probability of hypothesis $H$ becomes higher than its prior probability when new evidence $e$ is presented; that is, $P(H|e) > P(H)$. Let us apply this to the previous raven example. While the evidence of a "black raven" has a high probability of occurring if the hypothesis is true, a "white chalk," which is irrelevant to the hypothesis, has a nearly equal probability of existing regardless of the truth of the hypothesis. Therefore, Bayesianism practically resolves the logical paradox by treating the degree to which white chalk confirms the hypothesis as numerically close to zero.

Furthermore, Bayesianism is useful for explaining competitive situations between hypotheses. When two hypotheses, $H_1$ and $H_2$, compete regarding the same evidence $e$, Bayesians compare the likelihood and prior probability of each. If the probability of observing evidence $e$ under $H_1$ is significantly higher than under $H_2$, then that evidence supports $H_1$ more strongly. This demonstrates that scientific discovery is not a simple binary logic of truth and falsehood, but rather a dynamic process of gaining a probabilistic advantage.

However, criticisms of Bayesianism also exist. The primary point of contention is the subjectivity of "prior probability." The prior probability—the initial degree of belief assigned to a hypothesis before evidence is collected—must inevitably be set subjectively by each scientist. To this, Bayesians counter with the "convergence theorem." It argues that even if initial prior probabilities differ, the posterior probabilities will eventually converge to a single value if sufficient objective evidence is accumulated. Consequently, Bayesianism is evaluated as a rational model of modern science that starts from subjective human belief but reaches objective truth through rigorous mathematical updating.

### [Instructor’s One-Point Lesson]

1.  **Identify Causal Relationships**: You must find the proportional relationship in the text where the posterior probability $P(H|e)$ increases as the prior probability $P(H)$ and likelihood $P(e|H)$ increase. (This is a key point where calculation problems might arise!)
2.  **Verify the Opposing Structure**: Clearly distinguish between the differences of the hypothetico-deductive method (formal logic) versus Bayesianism (probabilistic logic).
3.  **Critique and Counter-argument**: The structure in the final paragraph—presenting the critique of "subjectivity" followed by the counter-argument of the "convergence theorem"—is a typical closing pattern for CSAT non-fiction.

**"If you have perfectly understood today's passage, you already possess the logical power of the top 1%. Do not give up until the end!"**
