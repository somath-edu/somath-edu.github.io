Recently, the trend of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been rapidly shifting beyond Large Language Models (LLMs) toward **“Physical AI,”** which can make decisions and move autonomously in real physical spaces. AI, which had previously been confined within digital screens communicating only through text and images, is now being placed into **“humanoids,”** or physical vessels that possess human-like forms. This shift suggests more than just an advancement in hardware; it indicates that we have reached a technological inflection point where machines can fundamentally replace areas of human labor.

Traditional industrial robots operated by repeating fixed paths, primarily because it was nearly impossible to manually code every single piece of data from the complex and unpredictable real world. This challenge is known as **“Moravec’s Paradox,”** the principle that high-level logical reasoning, which is difficult for humans, is easy for computers, while motor intelligence like walking or picking up objects, which is easy for humans, is extremely difficult for robots. However, recently emerged Physical AI is overcoming this paradox through Vision-Language Models (VLM) and reinforcement learning.

The core of Physical AI lies in an **“end-to-end”** learning system. In this method, a robot receives external stimuli through sensors (Input) and generates immediate actions (Output) through neural network processing without separate manual programming. By learning from countless videos, robots mimic human movements and acquire the laws of physics through tens of thousands of trials and errors in virtual “simulation” environments. Humanoids equipped with such “brains” are now demonstrating the ability to cook without breaking eggs or to sort items in complex logistics warehouses while avoiding obstacles.

From an economic perspective, the rise of Physical AI is regarded as a **“game changer”** that will solve chronic labor shortage problems. Robots such as Tesla’s “Optimus” or Figure AI’s “Figure 01” are designed to utilize existing human infrastructure. The fact that they can use the same tools and facilities used by humans and be deployed 24 hours a day without needing to remodel existing factories is a factor that can drastically lower manufacturing and logistics costs.

However, behind these technological advances, there are tasks that require critical reflection. As robots are integrated into human physical spaces, there is an urgent need for social consensus on issues of safety and liability, as well as structural unemployment that may occur when skilled labor, beyond simple manual tasks, is replaced. Furthermore, due to the nature of Physical AI, which must process vast amounts of data in real-time, enormous power consumption and data security issues remain difficult challenges to solve.

Ultimately, Physical AI is reproducing the process through which human intelligence has expanded by interacting with the world through the medium of the “body.” We are now at a point where we must redefine AI, moving away from viewing it as simple software and seeing it as an active agent that overcomes physical limitations. Whether this new technological paradigm will be a blessing that dramatically increases human productivity or a challenge that threatens the place of humans depends on our institutional preparation to control and operate this technology.
