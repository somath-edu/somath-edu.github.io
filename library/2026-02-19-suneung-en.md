**[Special Report] Technological Dependence or Independent Survival: The Economics of AI Sovereignty**

With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the world is entering an era of "Great AI Transformation." While AI models from global big tech companies, represented by ChatGPT, are occupying daily life, the most discussed topic in the IT industry and international politics is "Sovereign AI." This concept refers to a nation or an enterprise possessing independent AI capabilities by utilizing its own data, infrastructure, and human resources without relying on external powers.

In the past, national power was determined by territory, resources, and military strength; however, in today's accelerated digital transition, national power depends on "intelligent infrastructure" that processes data and creates value. Currently, the AI market is dominated by a few big tech firms in the U.S. and China that possess massive capital and computational resources. In this situation, nations that fail to establish their own AI models face serious crises beyond mere technical inferiority, such as the leakage of national data and the loss of cultural identity.

The primary reason why Sovereign AI is emphasized lies in securing "cultural value neutrality." AI models reflect the biases of the data they have learned. Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on data from English-speaking countries are highly likely to present Western norms and values as if they were the correct answers. This implies a possibility of distorting the subtle context of the Korean language, unique ethical standards of Korean society, and historical specificities. In other words, AI sovereignty is a defense mechanism to protect a nation's spiritual and cultural territory beyond simple technological independence.

The ripple effect on the economic side is also immense. AI is now the core engine that determines the efficiency of all industries. If a country becomes entirely dependent on a specific nation's AI infrastructure, wealth outflow due to massive usage fees, as well as data security issues, becomes inevitable. Furthermore, the country may fall into a state of "technological dependence" where public services or core industries could be paralyzed if supply chain risks occur. This is consistent with the context in which NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang emphasized that "each country must produce its own intelligence by utilizing its own data."

However, building Sovereign AI is by no means an easy task. It requires a triple crown of securing Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which are computing resources worth trillions of won, sophisticated software talent, and high-quality data. Experts agree that a "public-private partnership model," where bold government investment and private technological prowess are combined, is essential. In particular, Korea is evaluated as having sufficient potential to lead the Sovereign AI era, being one of the few countries equipped with world-class semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and hyper-scale AI models.

Ultimately, Sovereign AI is not a matter of choice but a matter of survival. As the competition for digital hegemony intensifies, the effort to secure one's own artificial intelligence is the task of expanding the "digital territory" to be handed down to future generations. The silent war of nations that refuse technological subordination and dream of intellectual independence has already begun.
