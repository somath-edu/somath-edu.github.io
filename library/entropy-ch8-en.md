> **Core Value**<br>
> **"Acknowledging the entropy (forgetting) of knowledge, and creating 'familiarity' and a 'flow of thought' instead of painful memorization."**

<br>

## Thought-Learning Beyond Note-Taking Limitations

-   **No Stress**: If you can't recall, look it up immediately. Eliminate the pain of forced recall.
-   **Thinking**: Save energy for memorization and use it for 'thinking' — connecting content and creating narratives.
-   **Socializing**: Perfection is not achieved alone but refined through conversations with friends.

## Tools Needed

-   [ ] **Obsidian**: Note-taking app (Free)
-   [ ] **AI Tools**: ChatGPT, Claude, etc. (For summarizing and generating information)
-   [ ] **Smartphone**: For photographing textbooks
-   [ ] **Notebook & Pen**: Portable size

## 1. Input and Verification

> **Principle**<br>
> "Delegate to AI, but ensure a solid start by cross-referencing with the original."

### STEP 1: Attending Class & Topic Recognition
-   During class, do not obsess over note-taking.
-   Focus on grasping **"the core topic and flow of today's lesson."**
-   Acknowledge that details will inevitably fade (entropy) and let them go.

### STEP 2: AI Material Generation Based on Original Sources
1.  **Capture**: Take a photo of the relevant content from textbooks or class materials and upload it to AI.
2.  **Prompt**: "Based on the content in this photo, summarize and explain it in an easy-to-understand way, tailored to my level."
3.  **Cross-reference (Essential)**: Absolutely compare the AI-generated material with the original textbook. (Verification of distortion/errors)

### STEP 3: Using the Obsidian App
-   Organize the verified content into an **Obsidian** folder.
-   Place images that can intuitively evoke the content.
-   Difficult vocabulary or sentences are created as `**[[연결 메모]]**` to ensure understanding without breaking the flow.

## 2. Thinking and Familiarity

> **Principle**<br>
> "If you can't recall, look it up immediately. The goal is to become familiar, as if ingraining it in your mind."

### STEP 4: Collecting Contextual Keywords
-   Close Obsidian and transcribe only the **'Core Contextual Keywords'** of that chapter into a small notebook.
-   Do not write explanations. Just write the words, leaving **space** for thought.

### STEP 5: Storytelling While Walking
-   Regardless of location (while moving, in a cafe, etc.), take out your notebook.
-   Using the written contextual keywords as signposts, create a story with your own logic and murmur it aloud.

### STEP 6: Immediate Verification and Marking with a Dot (•)
-   If you get stuck while creating a story? **Absolutely do not struggle.**
-   **Verify**: Immediately open mobile Obsidian to check the content. Say "Ah, that's right" and re-ingrain it in your mind.
-   **Mark**: Place a **dot (•)** next to the verified word. (Marks frequently forgotten points)

## 3. Interaction and Completion

> **Principle**<br>
> "Complete your knowledge by using your shortcomings as conversation topics with friends."

![교류와 완성](/images/IMG_2324.webp)

### STEP 7: Chatting with Friends
-   Introduce the words marked with a **dot (•)** in your notebook as conversation topics with friends.
-   *"I keep forgetting this, how did you understand it?"*
-   *"I thought of it this way, does that make sense?"*
-   By chatting with friends, correct misconceptions and reinforce memories.

### STEP 8: Readjusting Obsidian
-   If you gained new perspectives or insights from conversations with friends, update your Obsidian content upon returning home.
-   Through this process, your own **true knowledge** is completed.
