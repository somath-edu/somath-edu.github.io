Our brain reacts very sensitively to external stimuli.

If a child is distracted even while sitting at a desk, it's highly probable that it's not due to the child's will. This is because the environment surrounding the child constantly emits **'disorder (entropy)'**.

This chapter analyzes **three major external factors** that attack a learner's brain.

## 1. Digital Entropy: Disorder in Your Pocket

Smartphones are the most powerful **'entropy generators'** in modern learning environments.

This is not simply a matter of "not studying because of gaming." From a neuroscience perspective, digital devices leave **Attention Residue**, destroying the brain's order.

### The Lie of Multitasking

Don't mistake solving problems while listening to music, or doing homework while chatting on KakaoTalk, as a 'skill'. The brain cannot process two highly demanding concentrations simultaneously.

What we believe to be multitasking is, in fact, repeatedly engaging in very rapid **'Task Switching'**.

> **The Cost of Task Switching**<br>
> Each time a switch occurs, the brain's energy is rapidly depleted. It's like a car that repeatedly stops and starts, resulting in the worst fuel efficiency.

Once the study flow is interrupted, it takes an **average of 23 minutes** to re-immerse. Checking a notification for 3 seconds is effectively ruining 20 minutes of study.

### Popcorn Brain

A brain accustomed to the intense stimuli of short-form content cannot tolerate boring stimuli like studying. The brain's circuitry itself shifts into a **'high-entropy state'**, chasing only immediate responses.

## 2. Environmental Entropy: Visual Noise

> **Common Question**<br>
> "If my desk is messy, isn't it okay as long as I study well?"

For most learners, an unorganized visual field acts as **'Visual Noise'**.

### Everything Visible Is a Burden

Our brain attempts to process all information that is visible. It unconsciously continuously 'scans' snack wrappers on the desk, unfinished comic books, and tangled wires.

It's like having numerous programs running in the computer's background. When trying to run the truly important 'study program', the brain lags.

> **Environment Shapes the Brain**<br>
> If the desk is disorderly, the brain also takes on that shape. If the environment is not organized, the brain is exhausted from the start.

## 3. Information Entropy: The Collector's Trap

The trap that enthusiastic students are most likely to fall into is **'material collection'**.

### Paradox of Choice

Textbooks, printouts, summaries that are said to be good... It might seem that the more materials, the better, but in reality, the opposite is true.

If there are too many materials, the brain expends all its energy choosing 'what to study'. This is called **'Decision Fatigue'**. As a result, one becomes exhausted without even starting to study.

### Fake Learning

Don't mistake merely accumulating materials for having studied. Undigested information is merely **'garbage data'**.

> **The Secret of Consolidation (Dan-gwon-hwa)**<br>
> The reason study masters perform "consolidation" is simple. It's to drastically reduce **information entropy** by compressing the scattered information from 10 volumes into 1 volume.
