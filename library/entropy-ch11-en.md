  “There are no right answers to wrong questions.<br>
  To uncover the true <strong>‘truth’</strong>, one must first remove the <strong>‘misconceptions’</strong> hidden within the questions.”
</div>

Here, I have compiled the most frequently asked questions from parents during my classes, along with the misconceptions hidden within them.

<br>

## Q1. "My child has given up on math."

<div style="background-color: #fff5f5; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #c53030;">Misconception</strong><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">Parents believe their child has ‘given up’ on math because it was too difficult after trying.</span>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f0fdf4; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #2f855a;">Truth</strong><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">“They haven’t given up. They’ve never truly ‘started’ math.”</span>
</div>

To give up on math, one must have first engaged with it. But can one truly be a ‘math-dropout’ if they've never properly started math in the first place?

So, what does it truly mean to **‘do math’**? Attending math classes, watching online lectures, memorizing what was taught in an academy… these are not truly ‘doing’ math. Simply following someone else’s instructions or a fixed timetable is merely receiving mathematical knowledge; it's not genuinely engaging with math.

True engagement with math looks like this: **“Hmm, shall I try solving this problem?”** It’s about voluntarily opening a problem and starting, without anyone's help or prompting. It’s like playing a game – you start when you want to, because it seems interesting.

Our child is not a ‘math-dropout,’ but rather **‘a child who hasn’t yet reached the starting line.’** Instead of saying, “You've already given up,” please tell them, **“You can do it when you feel like it.”** Waiting for an environment where the child can spontaneously think, “Shall I give it a try?” and begin – that is the true beginning.

## Q2. "They understand the basics, but can't apply them."

<div style="background-color: #fff5f5; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #c53030;">Misconception</strong><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">Parents view basic knowledge and application as separate stages.</span>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f0fdf4; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #2f855a;">Truth</strong><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">“Application is a fruit that naturally emerges, proportionate to the time spent reflecting on the basics.”</span>
</div>

![Basics and Application](/images/IMG_2518.webp)

If basic knowledge is limited to mere ‘formula memorization,’ application will not follow. Application problems inherently ask why a formula exists and how its principles connect.

Instead of solving more difficult problems to build application skills, if the time spent reflecting on the **‘principles’** of the basic knowledge they already possess increases to the point where they can explain it to someone else, application will naturally follow.

## Q3. "No matter how many academies I send them to, their grades stay the same."

<div style="background-color: #fff5f5; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #c53030;">Misconception</strong><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">Parents believe poor grades are due to insufficient learning.</span>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f0fdf4; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #2f855a;">Truth</strong><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">“It’s like continuously feeding a child who hasn't even digested their previous meal.”</span>
</div>

![Stagnant Grades](/images/IMG_2519.webp)

Grades are not proportionate to the time spent attending lectures, but to the **time spent independently organizing and reviewing.**

A child's mind is often already overwhelmed with too much information, leading to indigestion. What they need now is not a new academy, but **‘time for organization’** – to revisit what they’ve learned and make it their own.

Sometimes, grades only improve when the number of academies is reduced.

## Q4. "I'm worried because their progress is much slower than the neighbor's child."

<div style="background-color: #fff5f5; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #c53030;">Misconception</strong><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">Parents believe that learning quickly and extensively equates to skill.</span>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f0fdf4; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #2f855a;">Truth</strong><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">“Rapid speed creates confusion, while the right direction builds skill.”</span>
</div>

![Speed and Direction](/images/IMG_2520.webp)

Just as rushing the construction of a building leads to shoddy work, pushing for speed without comprehension only complicates the mind.

Slow progress can be evidence that the child is meticulously **‘understanding and organizing’** the content.

Learning is not a race of speed, but a competition of **‘how solidly one builds their foundation.’**

## Q5. "They forget everything they memorized yesterday. I guess they're not smart."

<div style="background-color: #fff5f5; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #c53030;">Misconception</strong><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">Parents view memory as a matter of innate talent.</span>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f0fdf4; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #2f855a;">Truth</strong><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">“It's not that they're not smart; they simply haven't ‘organized’ their thoughts.”</span>
</div>

![Forgetting and Organization](/images/IMG_2521.webp)

Can one blame the library for not finding books that were haphazardly thrown around?

Our brains deem information not meaningfully connected as useless and discard it. Forgetting is natural.

Memory isn't built by simple memorization, but by **‘understanding, connecting, and organizing’** information. When content is given an address (context), memory naturally follows.

## Q6. "They seem to know it, but they can't solve problems."

<div style="background-color: #fff5f5; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #c53030;">Misconception</strong><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">Parents mistake listening to explanations for ‘knowing’ something themselves.</span>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f0fdf4; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #2f855a;">Truth</strong><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">“What is seen with the eyes is merely information; true skill comes only from solving problems with one's hands and engaging in thought.”</span>
</div>

![Input and Output](/images/IMG_2522.webp)

When listening to a teacher's explanation, it often feels like one knows everything. However, that is the teacher's skill, not the child's. 'Deliberation' is input, but 'problem-solving' is output.

Appearing to know but being unable to solve problems is a sign of insufficient **retrieval (output) practice.** After hearing an explanation, the process of re-solving it on a blank sheet or explaining it oneself is essential for it to truly become ‘one’s own.’

## Q7. "When will they develop the habit of studying independently?"

<div style="background-color: #fff5f5; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #c53030;">Misconception</strong><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">Parents expect that if left alone, children will eventually mature and start studying.</span>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f0fdf4; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #2f855a;">Truth</strong><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">“‘My own studying’ truly begins when choices are given.”</span>
</div>

![Choice and Responsibility](/images/IMG_2529.webp)

It makes no sense for a mother to dictate academies, textbooks, and study times, then tell the child to “do it yourself.”

Simply following instructions is ‘labor,’ not ‘learning.’

Allow the child to choose and decide on even small things (e.g., picking a workbook, deciding break times). **Responsibility stems from choice.**

## Q8. "Won't using AI or digital devices diminish their thinking abilities?"

<div style="background-color: #fff5f5; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #c53030;">Misconception</strong><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">Parents believe digital tools are enemies of studying, and everything must be handwritten.</span>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f0fdf4; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #2f855a;">Truth</strong><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">“Tools are not at fault. How they are used is key.”</span>
</div>

![Utilizing Digital Tools](/images/IMG_2527.webp)

Having AI do homework instead is detrimental, but utilizing AI as **‘one’s personal teacher’** to ask questions tailored to one's level and **summarize** what has been understood makes it an excellent learning tool.

In the Entropy Learning Method, digital tools (such as note apps, AI, etc.) serve as a powerful **‘second brain’** for organizing and verifying complex information.

## Q10. "As a parent, what more should I do? I'm anxious."

<div style="background-color: #fff5f5; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #c53030;">Misconception</strong><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">Parents believe they must sacrifice more and help their child.</span>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f0fdf4; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #2f855a;">Truth</strong><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">“Do not transmit your parental ‘anxiety’ to your child.”</span>
</div>

![The Role of Parents](/images/IMG_2528.webp)

If parents waver, children will waver too.

The best role parents can play is not finding more information, but becoming a **‘steadfast and peaceful haven’** where the child can return to rest when facing difficulties.

**Only when parents' minds are stable will children also find stability.**
