  <strong style="color: #333;">💡 Core Message</strong><br><br>
  "Studying alone with the door closed is lonely. It is only when you open the door and communicate with others that your studies truly become organized."
</div>

Many students study hard, yet their grades do not improve. Why is that? Could it be that the order is wrong?<br>Much like building a structure without first laying a proper foundation.

<br>

## 1. Reversing the Order to Tame Disorder

We commonly refer to 'Ji-Deok-Che (智德體)' and prioritize study (knowledge).<br>However, this order is like building a castle on sand. Without a solid foundation, it quickly crumbles.

<div style="background-color: #f0fdf4; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #2f855a;">Spencer's Discovery: The Body Comes First</strong><br><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">Herbert Spencer, a 19th-century British educationalist, organized the proper order of study as follows:</span><br><br>
  <strong style="color: #2f855a;">📌 Correct Order: Che (體) → Deok (德) → Ji (智)</strong>
  <ul style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0; color: #555;">
    <li><strong>Che (Body)</strong>: An energy reservoir to withstand disorder</li>
    <li><strong>Deok (Relationships)</strong>: A channel for correcting errors and facilitating circulation</li>
    <li><strong>Ji (Wisdom)</strong>: Solid knowledge accumulated through this process</li>
  </ul>
</div>

If this order is disregarded, even the best study methods are futile. **Disorder inevitably resurfaces.**

## 2. Che (體): The Power of Learning

<div style="background-color: #fff5f5; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #c53030;">⚠️ The Truth of Neuroscience</strong><br><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">"When physical strength declines, the brain, to survive, shuts down learning functions first."</span>
</div>

Don't look at a child slumped over their desk and say, "They lack willpower." It's not a lack of willpower, but **energy depletion**.<br>When the body is exhausted, the brain switches to survival mode, and the energy for studying becomes '0'.

### Studying is Not About 'Butt Time' but 'Physical Stamina'

1.  **Sleep is Brain Cleaning Time**<br>Reducing sleep is like continuously piling up garbage in an uncleaned room. Brain waste is only cleared away during sleep.

2.  **Exercise is Brain Fertilizer**<br>30 minutes of sweating exercise daily produces growth hormones (BDNF) that nurture brain cells.

<div style="background-color: #fffbeb; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
  <strong style="color: #b45309;">✅ The True Meaning of Physical Stamina</strong><br><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">Physical stamina is not merely about being healthy. It is the <strong>'defense mechanism'</strong> that endures the stress and chaos of studying.</span>
</div>

<br>

<br>

## 3. Deok (德): The Power of Relationships

Here, 'Deok' does not mean being a good child.<br>In the context of studying, Deok signifies the **'ability to connect healthily with others'**.

### Doing It Alone Leads to Ruin: The Tragedy of Isolation

According to the laws of entropy in physics, a system isolated from the outside inevitably becomes disordered. The same applies to studying.

<div style="background-color: #fff5f5; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #c53030;">A child who closes their door and isolates themselves in their own world:</strong>
  <ul style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0; color: #555;">
    <li>Does not know what they are misunderstanding</li>
    <li>Fails to discover logical errors in their thinking</li>
    <li>Accumulates incorrect knowledge</li>
  </ul>
</div>

This is the **biggest pitfall of studying alone**.

### Relationships Correct Errors: The Miracle of Openness

Conversely, a child's brain that continuously communicates with friends, teachers, and parents is an 'open system'.

<div style="background-color: #f0fdf4; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #2f855a;">💬 Purification Effect Created by Relationships</strong>
  <ul style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0; color: #555;">
    <li><strong>Questions and Conversations</strong>: 'External energy' in the form of feedback from others enters and corrects errors in one's thinking.</li>
    <li><strong>Emotional Stability</strong>: Empathy and support, such as "It's okay," act as a coolant, calming an overheated brain.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

When communicating with people, the brain does not become isolated but continuously circulates and organizes itself. This is the principle by which 'Deok (relationships)' develops a learning mind.

<div style="background-color: #fffbeb; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
  <strong style="color: #b45309;">Relationship with Parents: The Most Important Safe Haven</strong><br><br>
  <span style="color: #333;">The most crucial relationship is with parents. A child's brain, anxious about their parents' reactions, is in an 'emergency state'.<br>
  When survival instincts are activated, rational thought (frontal lobe) becomes paralyzed. <strong>Grades flourish only on the foundation of trust between parents and children.</strong></span>
</div>

## 4. Ji (智): The Power of Understanding

If energy is secured through Che (body) and errors are filtered out through Deok (relationships), only then is **true wisdom** finally achieved.

Here, Ji (智) is not mere knowledge (what has been memorized). It refers to the state of **'wisdom (what has been understood)'**, where information is connected and organized, ready to be utilized at any time.

![Wisdom Image](/images/IMG_2514.webp)

*   **Knowledge**: Scattered information found on the internet (disorder)
*   **Wisdom**: Insights connected and organized within one's mind (order)

Only knowledge accumulated within a healthy body and open relationships becomes true competence that does not vanish after exams.

## 5. Che-Deok-Ji Practical Roadmap

If a child is struggling with their studies, instead of changing problem sets, one must **re-evaluate the order**.

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #333;">Step 1. Che (體) Check - Assess Body Condition</strong>
  <ul style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0; color: #555;">
    <li>Are they sleeping at least 7 hours or more?</li>
    <li>Are they exercising, sweating for 30 minutes, 3 times a week?</li>
    <li>Are they eating meals on time and drinking enough water?</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <strong style="color: #2f855a;">→ Address the body's disorder first.</strong>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <strong style="color: #333;">Step 2. Deok (德) Check - Assess Relationship Status</strong>
  <ul style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0; color: #555;">
    <li>Are they not ashamed to ask questions about what they don't know?</li>
    <li>Do they feel comfortable talking with parents and friends?</li>
    <li>Are they not struggling alone and isolated?</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <strong style="color: #2f855a;">→ Open the mind's door to ventilate the brain.</strong>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
  <strong style="color: #333;">Step 3. Ji (智) Check - Assess Knowledge Status</strong>
  <ul style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0; color: #555;">
    <li>Are they organizing what they've learned in their own way?</li>
    <li>Can they easily explain it to others?</li>
    <li>Are they studying with understanding, not just rote memorization?</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <strong style="color: #2f855a;">→ Only then, build the tower of knowledge.</strong>
</div>

<br>

<br>

## Concluding: Unwavering Roots

<div style="background-color: #fffbeb; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
  <strong style="color: #b45309;">"Endure with Che (body), connect with Deok (relationships), and complete with Ji (wisdom)."</strong>
</div>

The goal of this book is not merely to create the top student in school.<br>It is about fostering a **'resilient individual'** who, no matter what chaotic situation arises, takes care of their body, communicates with others, and wisely solves problems.

The moment you close this book, instead of telling your child to "study," offer them **a warm meal and eye contact**.<br>That is the quickest way to reduce disorder.
