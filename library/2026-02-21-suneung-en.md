**[Analysis] A Shift in the Artificial Intelligence Paradigm: The Leap from LLMs to 'AI Agents'**

The most prominent discourse within the current information technology (IT) industry undoubtedly revolves around the emergence of "AI Agents." While the generative AI of the past few years, centered on ChatGPT, remained at the level of a "language model" that merely provides answers to user inquiries, we are now entering an era of "agents" that perceive user intentions to formulate plans and complete executions autonomously. This signifies more than just a technological advancement; it heralds a fundamental change in the way humans and computers interact.

If traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) served as "repositories of knowledge" by generating contextually appropriate text based on vast datasets, AI Agents introduce the dimensions of "autonomy" and "execution." For instance, when a user asks a conventional AI to "plan a trip to Jeju Island," the system limits its response to providing a text-based list of optimal routes and famous restaurants. In contrast, an AI Agent takes the steps to finalize actual tasks—such as purchasing flight tickets, reserving accommodations, and communicating with car rental agencies—while considering the user’s budget and preferences.

The core driving force making this shift possible lies in the combination of "reasoning capabilities" and "tool-use abilities." To achieve a given goal, an AI Agent self-defines the necessary sub-tasks. When presented with a complex assignment, the agent breaks it down into logical steps (Chain of Thought) and directly invokes external tools, such as email, calendars, or web browsers, at each stage. The process of self-correcting errors that arise during this sequence and approaching the final result is remarkably analogous to the human problem-solving process.

Economic experts project that the proliferation of AI Agents will fundamentally reshape the structure of labor productivity. This is because AI can now perform not only repetitive and standardized tasks but also complex office work requiring the manipulation of various software, thereby maximizing the possibility of "one-person enterprises." However, the future is not without its shadows. As AI Agents become deeply involved in personal data and exercise financial authority, controversies regarding security breaches and ethical responsibility are intensifying. Legal discussions regarding who should be held accountable when an autonomous decision by an AI causes harm to a user remain in an embryonic stage.

From an educational perspective, the rise of AI Agents aligns with classical themes of "internalization of technology" and "human alienation." As technology begins to substitute for human critical thinking processes, questions regarding what essential capabilities remain for humans are likely to become frequent subjects in reading comprehension assessments. We must now perceive AI not simply as a "smart encyclopedia," but as a "social actor" that shares our daily lives and supports decision-making. A reflective attitude toward the limits of autonomy and the necessity of control hidden behind technological convenience is more indispensable than ever.

### **[오늘의 핵심 영단어]**

1. **Autonomy** (자율성): The capacity to make an informed, uncoerced decision and act independently.
2. **Execution** (실행, 완수): The carrying out or putting into effect of a plan, order, or course of action.
3. **Analogous** (유사한): Comparable in certain respects, typically in a way which makes clearer the nature of the things compared.
4. **Accountability** (책임, 의무): The fact or condition of being required or expected to justify actions or decisions.
5. **Indispensable** (없어서는 안 될, 필수적인): Absolutely necessary; that cannot be dispensed with or done without.
