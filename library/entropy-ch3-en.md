A quiet room, a clean desk, a turned-off smartphone. Even with a perfect environment set up, the child sits blankly or falls asleep face down within 30 minutes.

Parents feel frustrated, thinking "their will is weak," but in reality, a riot is erupting within the child's brain.

Even without external distractions, an incorrect learning approach generates immense disorder (entropy) within the brain. This state, where the brain's capacity is exceeded, is precisely **'Cognitive Overload.'**

## 1. Cognitive Load Theory: The Limits of the Brain as a Funnel

Our brain, specifically the **'Working Memory'** used during immediate study, has a very limited capacity. Neuroscientists state that humans can process only **4 to 7** chunks of information at a time.

### The Brain is Like a Narrow Funnel

Learning is the process of bringing external knowledge into working memory, processing it, and then storing it in the vast warehouse of long-term memory. However, high-entropy learning is akin to stuffing disorganized, raw information all at once into this narrow working memory channel.

> **Differences in Information Delivery Methods**<br>
> **💡 Low-Entropy State (Order)**<br>
> Handing over a well-organized stack of documents is easily received and processed. (Low load)<br><br>
> **🌪️ High-Entropy State (Disorder)**<br>
> If you throw 100 loose A4 sheets, the recipient will be too busy picking them up and organizing them to actually read the content. (Cognitive load occurs)

This is why attempts to underline everything and mindlessly memorize by thinking "this is important, that is important" fail. If information is not structured, the brain perceives it as 'noise' rather than 'knowledge,' and it undergoes a **Shutdown** due to overload.

## 2. "I Know Everything" Illusion: Metacognitive Error

The most dangerous state of entropy is **'the state of not knowing what you don't know.'**

### The Trap of Fluency Illusion

When children attend academy lectures or watch online courses, they nod their heads. This is because they are observing knowledge that the instructor has well-organized (in a low-entropy state). The brain feels comfortable as information flows smoothly, mistaking this comfort for 'knowing it themselves.'

This is called **'Fluency Illusion.'**

> **What is Fluency Illusion?**<br>
> The phenomenon where one feels they understand effortlessly when listening to an instructor's explanation or reading a textbook, but then cannot even begin to solve a problem when trying on their own.

However, when they try to solve problems on their own, they often fail. This is because it was the instructor's knowledge, not their own. The information that entered their minds is floating around, unable to find its proper place.

### Real Knowledge vs. Fake Knowledge

| Category | State | Characteristic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Real Knowledge** | Low entropy | Indexed, so it can be retrieved at any time |
| **Fake Knowledge** | High entropy | Buried in a warehouse, unknown where it is |

> **What is Metacognition?**<br>
> The ability to know what you know and what you don't know. The reason metacognition doesn't function is that the mind is in such a mess that one cannot even assess the current situation oneself.

### Metacognition Check Questions

Ask yourself:
- [ ] Can I explain this content with the book closed?
- [ ] Do I know why this formula is used?
- [ ] Can I accurately articulate which parts are difficult?
- [ ] Have I understood enough to teach it to a friend?

If you answer "No" to these questions, it is not yet real learning.

## 3. Symptoms: Burnout Caused by High Entropy

In physics, maintaining or trying to control a disordered state requires the most energy. The same applies to learning.

### The Moment the Brain Blows a Fuse

Holding onto a disorganized mind consumes an enormous amount of brain energy. When disorder reaches its peak and energy consumption becomes unsustainable, the brain automatically blows a fuse.

![Burnout](/images/IMG_1905.webp)

This is precisely **'learning helplessness'** and **'burnout.'**

> **The Brain's Cry**<br>
> "My mind is such a mess right now that I don't have the energy to process any more information!"

### Typical Symptoms of High-Entropy Learners
1. **Chronic Fatigue**: Feeling tired just by sitting at the desk
2. **Avoidance**: Continuously postponing the start of study
3. **Decreased Concentration**: Difficulty concentrating for even 5 minutes
4. **Anxiety and Restlessness**: Having much to do but being unable to accomplish anything

## Key Summary

| Concept | Description | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cognitive Overload** | Exceeding working memory capacity | Chunking information |
| **Fluency Illusion** | The brain's lie of 'knowing' | Explaining it oneself, retrieval practice |
| **Learning Helplessness** | Shutdown due to energy depletion | Reduce entropy, then restart |
