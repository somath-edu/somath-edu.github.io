A quiet room, a clean desk, a smartphone turned off. Even with a perfect environment created, the child sits idly or dozes off after less than 30 minutes.

Parents frustratingly label it as "lack of will," but in reality, a riot is erupting inside the child's brain.

Even without external distractions, faulty learning methods have created immense disorder (entropy) within the brain. This state, where the brain's capacity is exceeded, is precisely **'Cognitive Overload.'**

## 1. Cognitive Load Theory: The Limits of the Brain as a Funnel

Our brain, specifically the **'Working Memory'** used during active learning, has a very limited capacity. Neuroscientists state that humans can process only about **4 to 7 chunks** of information at a time.

### The Brain is Like a Narrow Funnel

Learning is the process of bringing external knowledge into working memory for processing, then storing it in the vast warehouse of long-term memory. However, high-entropy learning is akin to cramming raw, unorganized information all at once into this narrow working memory channel.

> **Difference in Information Delivery Methods**<br>
> **💡 Low-Entropy State (Order)**<br>
> Handing over a well-organized bundle of documents is easily received and processed. (Low load)<br><br>
> **🌪️ High-Entropy State (Disorder)**<br>
> If you throw 100 scattered A4 sheets, the recipient will be busy picking them up and organizing them, unable to actually read the content. (Cognitive load occurs)

This is why attempts to underline everything, thinking "this is important and that is important," and blindly memorize fail. If information is not structured, the brain perceives it as 'noise' rather than 'knowledge,' leading to a **shutdown** due to capacity overload.

## 2. The Illusion of "Knowing It All": Metacognitive Errors

The most dangerous state of entropy is **'not knowing what you don't know.'**

### The Trap of Fluency Illusion

When listening to academy lectures or watching online courses, children nod their heads. This is because they are observing knowledge that the instructor has well-organized (in a low-entropy state). The brain feels comfortable as information flows smoothly, mistaking this comfort for 'knowing it.'

This is called the **'Fluency Illusion.'**

> **What is Fluency Illusion?**<br>
> A phenomenon where explanations from an instructor or reading a textbook seem easy to understand, but when attempting to solve problems independently, one is unable to even start.

![유창성 착각](/images/IMG_1904.webp)

However, when they try to solve problems on their own, they find themselves stuck. This is because it was the instructor's knowledge, not their own. The information that entered their mind is floating around, unable to find its place.

### Real Knowledge vs. Fake Knowledge

| Category | State | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Real Knowledge** | Low entropy | Indexed, can be retrieved anytime |
| **Fake Knowledge** | High entropy | Stored away in a warehouse, its location unknown |

> **What is Metacognition?**<br>
> The ability to know what one knows and doesn't know. Metacognition fails to operate because the mind is in such disarray that one cannot even assess its current state.

### Metacognition Checklist Questions

Ask yourself:
- [ ] Can I explain this content without the book?
- [ ] Do I know why this formula is used?
- [ ] Can I accurately articulate which parts are difficult?
- [ ] Have I understood it well enough to teach a friend?

If you answer "no" to these questions, it's not real learning yet.

## 3. Symptoms: Burnout Caused by High Entropy

In physics, maintaining or controlling a disordered state requires the most energy. The same applies to learning.

### The Moment the Brain Blows a Fuse

Holding onto an unorganized mind consumes an immense amount of brain energy. When disorder reaches its peak and energy consumption becomes unsustainable, the brain "blows its own fuse."

![번아웃](/images/IMG_1905.webp)

This is precisely **'learning helplessness'** and **'burnout.'**

> **The Brain's Scream**<br>
> "My mind is in such a mess right now, I have no more energy to process information!"

### Typical Symptoms of a High-Entropy Learner
1.  **Chronic Fatigue**: Feeling tired just by sitting at the desk
2.  **Avoidance**: Constantly postponing the start of studying
3.  **Decreased Concentration**: Difficulty concentrating for even 5 minutes
4.  **Anxiety and Restlessness**: So much to do, but unable to do anything

## Key Summary

| Concept | Description | Solution Direction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cognitive Overload** | Working memory capacity exceeded | Chunking information |
| **Fluency Illusion** | The brain's pretense of knowing | Explaining to oneself, retrieval practice |
| **Learning Helplessness** | Shutdown due to energy depletion | Reducing entropy and restarting |
