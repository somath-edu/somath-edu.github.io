**[Opinion] Technological Dependency or Cultural Independence: The Inevitable Rise of ‘Sovereign AI’**

As generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology advances at an unprecedented pace, a new discourse that transcends mere technical superiority has emerged: “Sovereign AI.” Sovereign AI refers to the independent AI capabilities built by a nation or an enterprise by utilizing its own data and infrastructure while reflecting its unique cultural background. This movement is becoming a cornerstone of efforts to protect digital sovereignty and reduce reliance on general-purpose AI models led by global tech giants, such as OpenAI’s GPT series or Google’s Gemini.

The primary reason the world is paying attention to Sovereign AI lies in concerns regarding “data bias” and “cultural distortion.” Currently, the Large Language Models (LLMs) dominating the market are trained primarily on vast amounts of data from the Anglosphere. Consequently, these models often fail to accurately understand the context of non-English languages, such as Korean, or they present specific Western-centric values as universal norms. This issue is interpreted as a crisis of cultural identity, as a nation’s historical perception and social consensus could be reconstructed by AI algorithms.

Technological dependency from an economic perspective is also a critical factor that cannot be overlooked. Nations or companies that rely entirely on the AI models of specific global corporations inevitably become vulnerable to changes in subscription policies or the termination of API support. Furthermore, it is difficult to rule out the possibility that sensitive national secrets or core corporate technologies could be leaked through external cloud servers. Accordingly, major countries such as Saudi Arabia, France, and Japan are securing their own GPU computing resources and investing astronomical funds into developing models centered on their native languages, accelerating what is known as “AI fortification.”

However, building Sovereign AI does not guarantee a rosy future alone. The costs required to maintain hardware infrastructure, such as astronomical amounts of data and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), impose a significant financial burden on individual nations. Moreover, narrowing the performance gap with global models that already possess overwhelming capabilities is a challenge that is difficult to resolve in the short term. While adopting proven global models might be rational in terms of efficiency, the consensus among experts is that technological independence and data sovereignty are directly linked to national survival from a long-term perspective.

Ultimately, Sovereign AI should be understood not merely as a product of technological competition, but as a new strategy for territorial expansion and defense in the digital age. While South Korea possesses its own models like NAVER’s “HyperCLOVA X,” a more systematic response—such as expanding infrastructure and nurturing professional talent through public-private cooperation—is necessary to gain an edge in the global struggle for hegemony. At a time when AI is redesigning human thought processes and social systems, the initiative to determine through which eyes we view the world depends on the success of Sovereign AI.
