**[Opinion] Does AI Transition from a 'Tool' to a 'Proxy'?: The Rise and Challenges of Agentic AI**

Recently, the focal point of the Information Technology (IT) industry is undeniably "Agentic AI." Moving beyond the stage of "Generative AI," which simply provides answers to user inquiries, "AI agents" that independently set goals and execute complex tasks are emerging, rapidly shifting the industrial paradigm. This is being evaluated as a civilizational turning point comparable to the widespread adoption of the Internet or the advent of the smartphone. From the perspective of the "clash between technological progress and social values"—a theme frequently addressed in academic reading—it is necessary to analyze this phenomenon with a balanced view.

While conventional Generative AI has functioned as a "passive assistant" that generates text or images by understanding context based on Large Language Models (LLMs), Agentic AI aims to be an active "autonomous proxy." The core mechanism of an AI agent lies in the integration of "reasoning" and "action." When a user gives an abstract command, such as "Book a family trip to Jeju Island for next week," the AI voluntarily breaks down the request into detailed sub-tasks, such as reserving flight tickets, selecting accommodations, and booking restaurants. In this process, the AI interacts with external APIs to collect real-time data and exercises high-level judgment to devise alternatives when unexpected variables arise.

Such technological advancement heralds revolutionary changes throughout the economic structure. In terms of productivity, AI agents can drastically replace human cognitive labor. As AI penetrates not only repetitive and standardized tasks but also fields requiring high-level strategic judgment, corporate operational efficiency is expected to be maximized. However, behind this efficiency lies the long-standing challenge of labor market restructuring. As AI becomes capable of "proxy performance" even in professional sectors, the time has come to raise fundamental questions about what unique values only humans can possess.

Furthermore, "autonomy" inevitably entails the issue of "responsibility." When an AI agent makes a decision independently, to whom does the resulting legal and ethical liability belong? For instance, if a financial investment agent causes massive losses due to an algorithmic error, or if a booking agent concludes a contract based on incorrect information, is the responsible party the developer, the user, or the AI itself? Current legal systems are designed on the premise of meaningful human intervention, showing clear limitations in filling the legal vacuum created by autonomous AI.

Moreover, the problem of "hallucination" becomes a more fatal risk factor in the era of Agentic AI. While errors in simple answers result only in the distortion of information, errors made by an agent with the power to execute actions lead directly to actual physical and economic damage. The "black box" phenomenon, where the internal processing stages of AI remain opaque while it independently designs logical paths, is a destabilizing factor that threatens human controllability.

Ultimately, the arrival of Agentic AI presents us with the difficult task of "controlled autonomy" alongside technological convenience. Rather than being intoxicated by the speed of innovation, we must establish sophisticated "guardrails" to ensure that technology does not undermine human dignity and social order. This is why constructing "human-centric technology governance"—which maximizes AI's potential while maintaining human initiative—is urgent. Just as the core of reading comprehension is to grasp the logic behind the text, we desperately need the insight to perceive the essential risks and opportunities hidden behind rapidly changing technological trends.
