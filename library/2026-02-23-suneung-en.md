## [Perspective] The Era of “Click-less” Search: Can the Digital Ecosystem Coexist?

The most burning topic in the recent IT industry is, without a doubt, the paradigm shift toward “AI search.” The “list-based search” method of Google, which has dominated the global internet market for decades, is facing a powerful challenge from generative AI search services such as OpenAI’s “SearchGPT” or Perplexity. This is an event that goes beyond simple technical progress, shaking the very foundation of the digital ecosystem where information is produced, consumed, and monetized.

Traditional search engines operated by listing web page links related to keywords entered by a user. Users would “click” one of the suggested links, move to the site, and then acquire information. In this process, the media outlets or blogs that provided the information secured a number of visitors, and an economic reward system based on advertising revenue functioned. However, AI search is different. AI directly reads numerous web pages and then provides the optimal answer to a question by summarizing it. Users find themselves in a “Zero-click search” environment where they no longer need to click links leading to external sites.

At the core of this change lies “Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)” technology. RAG does not rely solely on fixed data that the AI has learned; instead, it searches for relevant and reliable external data in real-time at the moment a question is asked and generates an answer based on that content. Through this, it has reduced “hallucinations,” a chronic problem of AI, and increased the accuracy of information. Paradoxically, however, by delivering more sophisticated summaries of others' content, it has resulted in blocking traffic to the original creators' platforms.

This is where economic and legal conflicts arise. Major news organizations, including The New York Times (NYT), and content creators argue that AI companies are not only training on their intellectual property without authorization but are now threatening their right to survival by replacing original texts even in search results. On the other hand, AI companies counter that using publicly available information on the internet falls within the scope of “Fair Use” and increases social utility through more efficient information delivery.

Ultimately, the core of this debate lies in whether a “sustainable model for ecosystem coexistence” can be found. If high-quality content is not produced, the quality of the data that AI refers to will inevitably deteriorate. The recent actions of some AI companies—signing paid content usage agreements with news outlets or introducing UIs that clearly indicate sources at the bottom of search results to encourage clicks—are reflections of this sense of crisis.

Students should pay attention to how the development of technology reshapes existing societal agreements and economic systems through this phenomenon. When the two values of information efficiency and copyright protection collide, with what logic do laws and institutions find a new point of equilibrium? Literacy in the age of artificial intelligence must go beyond the ability to simply read text and include the ability to gain insight into the flow of data and the relationships of rights hidden behind it. The era of search is passing and the era of answers is coming, but without respect for the “source” that creates those answers, the fountain of knowledge may soon run dry.
