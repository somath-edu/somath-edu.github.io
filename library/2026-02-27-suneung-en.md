### [Editorial] The Video Revolution Sparked by Generative AI: Are We Ready to Embrace the ‘Virtual’?

Recently, the most prominent topic in the global IT industry is undoubtedly the remarkable progress of "Text-to-Video" technology. Starting with OpenAI’s "Sora," various recently unveiled artificial intelligence models are shocking the world by instantly creating high-definition videos that look as if they were filmed in real life, based on just a few lines of text. This is a momentous event that goes beyond mere technical advancement, shaking the epistemological foundation that "seeing is believing," which humanity has maintained for a long time.

The core principle of these video-generating AI models lies in the combination of "Diffusion Models" and "Transformer" architectures trained on massive datasets. While conventional methods generated each frame of a video individually, the latest models grasp the physical movements and causal relationships of objects within the video both spatially and temporally. For instance, if one enters a sentence about a cup falling to the floor, the AI calculates and reproduces everything from the direction of the glass shards to the refraction of light. This signifies a "production paradigm shift" that integrates the essential stages of video production—shooting, lighting, and editing—into software computation.

From an economic perspective, video-generating AI is expected to fundamentally change the landscape of the content industry. This is because costs and time can be drastically reduced in the film industry and advertising production, where vast amounts of capital used to be invested. Optimism is gaining ground, suggesting that the diversity of content will be maximized as an era opens where individual creators can implement blockbuster-level visual effects without large-scale capital. Simultaneously, however, job insecurity for traditional video industry workers and philosophical debates over the concept of creativity have emerged as unavoidable challenges.

A more significant problem is the potential collapse of social trust systems. If sophisticated "deepfake" videos are exploited for political manipulation or financial crimes, their impact will be beyond imagination. When fake news is disseminated through videos that perfectly implement the voices and expressions of real people, the public will fall into confusion about what to believe as truth. This carries the risk of paralyzing the rational public sphere, which is the very foundation of democracy.

Ultimately, the evolution of technology leaves us with two major tasks. First is the establishment of legal and institutional frameworks to prevent technical misuse, along with technical defense systems such as "digital watermarks." Second is the cultivation of "media literacy" among audiences to critically accept information. At a time when AI is breaking down the boundary between reality and virtualization, the most important values we must protect are not the technology itself, but rather the ethical responsibility of the humans who handle it and the sharp insight to discern the truth.
