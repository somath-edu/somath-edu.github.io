**[Analysis] From Answering Questions to Executing Tasks: The Evolution and Challenges of AI Agents**

The current discourse in the information technology (IT) industry is centered on a pivotal concept: the "AI Agent." While generative artificial intelligence, represented by ChatGPT, has previously functioned as a "secretary" that answers questions or generates text, it is now evolving into a "delegate" capable of setting its own goals, manipulating computer systems, and completing complex tasks. This technological transition is more than just an increase in convenience; it is fundamentally restructuring the collaborative framework between humans and machines.

The core mechanisms of an AI agent lie in "autonomous reasoning" and "tool-use capability." While traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) operate by predicting the next word based on the probabilistic statistics of input data, agentic AI decomposes a given complex goal into smaller sub-tasks. It then selects and executes the necessary external tools—such as web browsers, email clients, or coding software—to achieve those objectives. For instance, if a user commands, "Plan a trip to Paris next month and book flights and hotels within my budget," the AI independently navigates websites, compares prices, and performs the tasks up to the final payment stage.

From an economic perspective, this shift is expected to serve as a catalyst for breaking through the "threshold of productivity." This is because AI can now replace not only repetitive and standardized work but also unstructured tasks that require high-level judgment. Particularly in fields like software development, data analysis, and customer service, AI agents enable 24/7 continuous operations with minimal human intervention. While this signifies cost reduction and the maximization of efficiency for corporations, it simultaneously forces the labor market to confront serious existential questions regarding the "role of humans."

However, beneath these optimistic technological prospects lurk sharp, double-edged risks. The primary concern is the uncertainty of control arising from "autonomy." Errors or biases that may occur while an AI makes judgments without specific human instructions could lead to unforeseen societal losses. Furthermore, due to their nature of accessing personal information to perform tasks, security vulnerabilities become a fatal threat. If an AI agent abuses its authority or is utilized as a channel for hacking, the scale of the resulting damage will inevitably be on a different dimension compared to traditional data breaches.

Ultimately, the success of the AI agent era depends not on the advancement of technology itself, but on the "design of responsibility." Before AI acts autonomously, a social consensus must be established regarding who should be held legally and ethically accountable for the outcomes. We are currently standing before a massive paradigm shift, questioning whether to view AI as a mere tool or to recognize it as a social actor. It is time to engage in rigorous reflection on the balance between authority and responsibility, hidden behind the convenience of technology.

**[Senior Editor's Note]**
"In an era where AI becomes the hands and feet of humanity, we paradoxically find ourselves on a testing ground where we must prove the value of 'judgment that only humans can provide.'"
