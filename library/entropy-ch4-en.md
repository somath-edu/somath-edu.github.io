## 1. The Brain Craves Order: The Aesthetics of Patterns and Structure

> **A Question**<br>
> Between a complex maze and a well-paved straight road, which would your brain prefer?

### The Brain is an Energy-Saving Organ

The human brain instinctively tries to conserve energy. Processing disordered and complex information (high-entropy) requires enormous energy, whereas patterned and simple information (low-entropy) can be processed quickly with less energy.

The brain might appear lazy, but it is, in fact, incredibly wise. It prevents unnecessary energy consumption, reserving it for truly crucial moments.

> **The Mark of Genius**<br>
> "Geniuses are those who make complex things simple."

### Children Who Study Well vs. Children Who Struggle with Studying

A characteristic of children who excel at studying is their ability to condense the vast text of textbooks into their own language, using simple diagrams or a few keywords.

Conversely, children who struggle with studying tend to highlight every word, deeming it all important. As a result, the entire book turns yellow.

| Children Who Study Well | Children Who Struggle with Studying |
| :--- | :--- |
| Summarizes with 3 core keywords | Underlines every sentence |
| Structures with diagrams | Memorizes text verbatim |
| "Ultimately, this is that." | "Everything looks important." |

> **The Essence of Learning Ability**<br>
> The core of learning ability is the **'capacity to reduce Complexity to Simplicity,'** in other words, the ability to self-decrease entropy.

## 2. Minimal Learningism: The Core Becomes Clearer as You Subtract

### The Vicious Cycle Created by Anxiety

Driven by anxiety, we constantly add more.
* Buying more workbooks
* Enrolling in more academies
* Increasing study hours

![The trap of adding](/images/IMG_1656.webp)

However, according to the law of entropy, **as a system becomes more complex, disorder increases.**

> **The Trap of Adding**<br>
> More → More Complex → More Disordered → More Confused → Stagnant Performance

### Declaration of Minimal Learningism

It is now time to declare **'Minimal Learningism.'**

> **What is Minimal Learningism?**<br>
> It's not about studying less. It's about eliminating 'impurities' that hinder the essence of learning.

### Do Less, But Do It Deeply

- **One thorough reading of a single book** is better than **ten superficial readings.**
- **One hour of 'real study' with full immersion** is better than **ten hours of meaningless 'bottom-on-chair study.'**

| Before (Quantity-focused) | After (Quality-focused) |
| :--- | :--- |
| 10 superficial readings | 1 thorough reading |
| 10 meaningless hours | 1 hour of immersion |
| Attending 5 academies | Mastering 1 core concept |

> **The Philosophy of Emptying**<br>
> Only by subtracting can the core finally become visible. A full cup cannot hold new water.

To lower the brain's entropy, **'emptying'** must first precede it.

## 3. [Strategy] A 3-Step Process for Reducing Entropy

So, how can we specifically reduce entropy?
All practical methods that follow adhere to the next 3-step principle. Imprint this process in your mind.

### Step 1. Awareness: "Is it disordered right now?"

> **The First Step: Stop**<br>
> The very first thing to do is **'stop.'**

Stop running aimlessly, and **objectively observe** how chaotic your desk, your mind, and your study method currently are.

![Awareness](/images/IMG_1663.webp)

**Acknowledging that it's a mess is the beginning of order.**

#### Awareness Phase Checklist
- [ ] Are there unnecessary items on your desk?
- [ ] Is there unorganized information floating in your mind?
- [ ] Is your study plan unrealistically complex?
- [ ] Do you accurately know what you don't know?
- [ ] Are you reviewing the same content redundantly across multiple textbooks?

### Step 2. Removal: "What is unnecessary?"

> **The Second Step: Bold Deletion**<br>
> Boldly delete everything that does not contribute to your learning goals.

![Removal](/images/IMG_1661.webp)

Physically and mentally block out noise such as smartphones on your desk, distracting thoughts, and unnecessary preparatory learning materials. This is the **stage of reducing the total amount of information your brain needs to process.**

#### List of Items for Removal
* **Physical Removal**: Smartphones, unused reference books, visual clutter
* **Mental Removal**: Distracting thoughts, compulsions, regrets, comparisons
* **Learning Material Removal**: Redundant workbooks, unsuitable study methods, unused lecture notes

> **The Golden Question for Removal**<br>
> **"Does this directly contribute to achieving my learning goals?"**<br>
> If the answer is 'No' or if you hesitate → Discard it boldly.

---

### Step 3. Structure: "How will you connect them?"

> **The Third Step: Systematic Rearrangement**<br>
> Rearrange the remaining core information according to logical order and hierarchy.

Group individual pieces of information (Chunking), create an outline, and establish connections. This is the **final stage of transforming a disordered pile into an organized filing cabinet.**

#### 3 Core Techniques for Structuring

**1. Chunking: Group Information**<br>
This is the process of binding scattered information into meaningful chunks.

![Chunking](/images/IMG_1911.webp)

**2. Hierarchy: Establish Order of Importance**<br>
Create a hierarchy from the big picture down to specific details.

![Hierarchy](/images/IMG_1910.webp)

**3. Connection: Create Links**<br>
Connect new information with existing knowledge.

> **The Power of Connection**<br>
> "This formula is an extension of the concept I learned last time."<br>
> "This historical event connects with what I learned in economics class."

![Connection](/images/IMG_1912.webp)

#### Practical Examples of Structuring
* **Before Structuring**: Memorizing 100 English words randomly
* **After Structuring**:
    * Group by topic (20 food words, 15 emotion words, 10 occupation words...)
    * Connect by etymology (pre-, post-, anti-...)
    * Weave into a story

## The 3-Step Process at a Glance

| Step | Key Question | Action | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Step 1<br>Awareness** | Is it disordered right now? | Assess current state | Problem identification |
| **Step 2<br>Removal** | What is unnecessary? | Delete non-goal-related items | Noise elimination |
| **Step 3<br>Structure** | How will you connect them? | Chunking, Hierarchy, Connection | Systematic order |

> **Key Message**<br>
> All upcoming learning strategies will follow these 3 steps:<br>
> **Awareness → Removal → Structure**<br>
> Skipping or altering this sequence will halve its effectiveness.
