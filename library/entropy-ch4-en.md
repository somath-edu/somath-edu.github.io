## 1. The Brain Craves Order: The Aesthetics of Patterns and Structure

> **A Question**<br>
> Between a complex maze and a well-paved straight road, which would your brain prefer?

### The Brain is an Energy-Saving Organ

The human brain instinctively strives to conserve energy. Processing chaotic and complex information (high entropy) requires immense energy, whereas patterned and simple information (low entropy) can be processed quickly with little energy.

![뇌의 에너지 절약](/images/IMG_1652.webp)

The brain might seem lazy, but it is, in fact, very wise. It prevents unnecessary energy consumption, hoarding it for truly crucial moments.

> **The Mark of a Genius**<br>
> "Geniuses are those who simplify the complex."

### High-Achieving Student vs. Struggling Student

A characteristic of high-achieving students is their ability to condense the vast text of textbooks into their own language, using simple diagrams or a few keywords.

In contrast, struggling students tend to think every single word is important and underline everything with a highlighter. Consequently, the entire book turns yellow.

| High-Achieving Student | Struggling Student |
| :--- | :--- |
| Summarizes with 3 key keywords | Underlines every sentence |
| Structures with diagrams | Memorizes text verbatim |
| "It boils down to this" | "Everything seems important" |

> **The Essence of Learning Ability**<br>
> The core of learning ability is the **'capacity to reduce Complexity to Simplicity'**, in other words, the ability to self-decrease entropy.

## 2. Minimal Learningism: The Core Becomes Clearer the More You Remove

### The Vicious Cycle Created by Anxiety

We keep adding things due to anxiety.
*   We buy more workbooks
*   We enroll in more academies
*   We increase study hours

![더하기의 함정](/images/IMG_1656.webp)

However, according to the law of entropy, **disorder increases as a system becomes more complex.**

> **The Trap of Addition**<br>
> More → More Complex → More Disorder → More Confusion → Stagnant Grades

### Declaration of Minimal Learningism

Now, we must declare **'Minimal Learningism'**.

> **What is Minimal Learningism?**<br>
> It's not about studying less. It's about removing 'impurities' that hinder the essence of learning.

### Do Less, But Deeply

-   One thorough reading of a single book is better than a superficial reading of ten books.
-   One hour of immersive, 'real study' is better than ten meaningless hours of 'butt-in-chair study.'

| Before (Quantity-focused) | After (Quality-focused) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Superficial reading of 10 books | Thorough reading of 1 book |
| 10 meaningless hours | 1 hour of immersion |
| Rushing through 5 academies | Perfect mastery of 1 core concept |

> **The Philosophy of Letting Go**<br>
> Only by letting go does the core become visible. A full cup cannot hold new water.

To lower the brain's entropy, **'emptying'** must first precede it.

## 3. [Strategy] A 3-Step Process for Lowering Entropy

So, how exactly can we lower entropy?
All practical methods that follow will adhere to the subsequent 3-step principle. Engrave this process in your mind.

### Step 1. Awareness: "Is there disorder now?"

> **The First Step: Stop**<br>
> The very first thing to do is to **'stop'**.

Stop running blindly, and **objectively assess** how chaotic your desk, your mind, and your study methods currently are.

![인지](/images/IMG_1663.webp)

**Admitting that it's a mess is the beginning of order.**

#### Awareness Stage Checklist
- [ ] Are there unnecessary items on your desk?
- [ ] Is unorganized information floating around in your mind?
- [ ] Is your study plan unrealistically complex?
- [ ] Do you accurately understand what you don't know?
- [ ] Are you reviewing the same content redundantly across multiple textbooks?

### Step 2. Removal: "What is unnecessary?"

> **The Second Step: Radical Removal**<br>
> Radically remove everything that does not contribute to your learning goals.

![제거](/images/IMG_1661.webp)

Physically and mentally block out noise such as smartphones on your desk, distracting thoughts, and unnecessary preparatory learning materials. This is the stage that **reduces the total amount of information the brain has to process**.

#### Removal Target List
*   **Physical Removal**: Smartphone, unused reference books, visual distractions
*   **Mental Removal**: Distracting thoughts, compulsions, regrets, comparisons
*   **Learning Material Removal**: Redundant workbooks, unsuitable study methods, unused notes

> **The Golden Question of Removal**<br>
> **"Does this directly help me achieve my learning goals?"**<br>
> If the answer is 'No' or you hesitate → discard it decisively.

---

### Step 3. Structure: "How will it be connected?"

> **The Third Step: Systematic Rearrangement**<br>
> Rearrange the remaining core information according to logical order and hierarchy.

Group individual pieces of information (Chunking), create an outline, and establish connections. This is the **final stage of transforming a disorganized pile into a systematic filing cabinet.**

#### 3 Core Techniques of Structuring

**1. Chunking: Group Information**
This is the process of grouping scattered information into meaningful chunks.

![청킹](/images/IMG_1911.webp)

**2. Hierarchy: Establish Order of Importance**
Create a hierarchy from the big picture down to the details.

![위계화](/images/IMG_1910.webp)

**3. Connection: Create Links**
Connect new information with existing knowledge.

> **The Power of Connection**<br>
> "This formula is an extension of the concept I learned last time."<br>
> "This historical event connects to what I learned in economics class."

![연결화](/images/IMG_1912.webp)

#### Practical Examples of Structuring
*   **Before Structuring**: Memorizing 100 English words randomly
*   **After Structuring**:
    *   Group by theme (20 food items, 15 emotions, 10 occupations...)
    *   Connect by etymology (pre-, post-, anti-...)
    *   Weave into a story

## 3-Step Process at a Glance

| Step | Key Question | Action Content | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Step 1<br>Awareness** | Is there disorder now? | Assess current state | Problem Recognition |
| **Step 2<br>Removal** | What is unnecessary? | Delete irrelevant to goals | Noise Reduction |
| **Step 3<br>Structure** | How to connect? | Chunking · Hierarchy · Connection | Systematic Order |

> **Key Message**<br>
> All upcoming learning strategies will follow these 3 steps:<br>
> **Awareness → Removal → Structure**<br>
> If this order is changed or skipped, the effectiveness will be halved.
