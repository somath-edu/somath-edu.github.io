## 1. Physics' Entropy Enters the Classroom

The universe, if left undisturbed, tends towards increasing disorder. This is evident in how ice in a cup melts into water, or how a tidied room inevitably becomes cluttered after just a few days.

In physics, this degree of disorder is called **'Entropy'**.
*   **High entropy**: A state of disorder and chaos.
*   **Low entropy**: An organized and systematic state.

Interestingly, this law of nature applies equally to our children's minds, specifically in the realm of **'learning'**.

> **What is Learning Entropy?**<br>
> It is an indicator of how chaotically information input into the brain is scattered.

Many parents and students believe "studying is a battle of endurance," and try to indiscriminately cram as much information as possible into their heads. However, from the brain's perspective, **unstructured information is merely 'noise.'**

Let's imagine a scenario: a library with 10,000 books. If these books are shelved according to a classification system, we can find any desired book within 10 seconds.

But what if the same 10,000 books are piled haphazardly on the floor? The information certainly exists, but it's nothing more than a **'pile of garbage that cannot be retrieved.'**

> **Self-Diagnosis**<br>
> Is your (or your child's) mind currently a **'well-organized bookshelf'** or a **'warehouse piled high with books'**?

## 2. An Era Where 'Hard Work' Alone Isn't Enough

We often hear these complaints:

> **Parents' Concerns**<br>
> "My child sits at their desk for a long time, but their grades don't improve."<br>
> "I memorized it all night yesterday, but when I saw the test paper today, it was completely forgotten."

This is not due to a lack of effort. <br>
It's because **learning entropy has exceeded a critical threshold.**

In the past, when the volume of information was smaller, simply cramming a lot of it was sufficient for good results. However, we are now in an age of information overload. If one continues to indiscriminately input information without a system to process and organize the deluge, the brain will suffer from overload.

### Different Ways of Using the Brain

**🤯 High-Entropy Learners**<br>
They waste energy not on 'studying' itself, but on enduring the mental chaos. By expending all their brain energy searching for desired knowledge, they have no power left to actually solve problems.

**💡 Low-Entropy Learners**<br>
They grasp the core concepts even with less study. This is because the knowledge within their brains is solidly interconnected and well-ordered.

> **A Paradigm Shift**<br>
> Now, it's no longer about **'how long one has studied (input quantity)'** but rather **'how systematically one has stored information (entropy management)'** that determines academic performance.

## 3. [Diagnosis] Check Your Child's Disorder Level

How disordered is their current learning state? Use the checklist below to assess the invisible 'learning entropy' level.

### 📋 Learning Entropy Self-Diagnosis Checklist

- [ ] **Inability to explain**: Cannot explain what was just learned after closing the book.
- [ ] **Delayed start**: Spends more than 10 minutes doing other things before starting to study.
- [ ] **Searching for items**: Frequently spends time looking for pens, printouts, etc.
- [ ] **Metacognitive error**: Mistakes visual familiarity for true understanding, leading to incorrect answers.
- [ ] **Lack of context**: Memorizes words and formulas but doesn't understand the overall flow of the unit.
- [ ] **Chronic anxiety**: Feels anxious if not studying, but can't focus even when sitting down to study.
- [ ] **Multitasking**: Must immediately check notifications that arrive during study sessions.
- [ ] **Flawed execution**: Grand plans fizzle out after less than 3 days.
- [ ] **Inability to apply**: Can solve textbook problems but can't even attempt application problems.
- [ ] **Burnout**: Feels mentally drained and lacks motivation after an exam.

### 📊 Diagnosis Results

> **0-2 items (Stable: Low Entropy)**<br>
> Efficiency is very high. Knowledge is systematically organized. Maintain the current flow and try to increase your pace.

> **3-6 items (Caution: Medium Entropy)**<br>
> You work hard, but efficiency is low. Disorder is subtly creeping in. If you don't organize now, it will soon become critical.

> **7 or more items (Danger: High Entropy)**<br>
> This is an emergency. The brain is already in a state of chaos. Spending more time is like 'pouring water into a bottomless pit.' Start by 'emptying and organizing' first.
