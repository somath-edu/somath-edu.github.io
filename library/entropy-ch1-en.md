## 1. Physics' Entropy Enters the Classroom

The universe, if left undisturbed, tends towards increasing disorder. Just as ice in a cup melts into water, and a tidy room becomes cluttered after only a few days.

In physics, this degree of disorder is called **'Entropy'**.
*   **High Entropy**: A state of disorder and chaos
*   **Low Entropy**: An organized and systematic state

Interestingly, this law of nature applies equally to the minds of our children, specifically in the realm of **'learning'**.

> **What is Learning Entropy?**<br>
> It is an indicator of how chaotically scattered the information input into the brain is.

Many parents and students try to cram as much information as possible into their heads, believing that "studying is about sitting long hours." However, from the brain's perspective, **unstructured information is merely 'noise.'**

Let's imagine this: there are 10,000 books in a library. If these books are arranged on shelves according to a classification system, we can find the desired book in 10 seconds.

But what if the same 10,000 books are piled haphazardly on the floor? The information certainly exists, but it's no different from a **heap of 'unretrievable' junk.**

> **Self-Diagnosis**<br>
> Is your (or your child's) mind currently a **'well-organized bookshelf'** or a **'warehouse of piled-up books'**?

## 2. The Era Where 'Hard Work' Alone Isn't Enough

We often hear these complaints:

> **Parents' Concerns**<br>
> "My child sits at their desk for a long time, but their grades don't improve."<br>
> "I memorized it all night yesterday, but when I saw the test paper today, my mind went completely blank."

This isn't due to a lack of effort. <br>It's because **learning entropy has exceeded its critical threshold.**

In the past, when the volume of information was smaller, simply cramming a lot into one's head yielded results. But now, we live in an age of information overload. If one continuously inputs information without a system to process and organize the deluge, the brain will become overloaded.

### Different Ways of Using the Brain

![High Entropy vs Low Entropy](/images/IMG_1898.webp)

🤯 **High-Entropy Learner**<br>
They waste energy not on 'studying' itself, but on enduring the chaos in their minds. They expend all their brain's energy searching for the knowledge they need, leaving no strength left to actually solve problems.

💡 **Low-Entropy Learner**<br>
They grasp the core concepts even with less study. This is because the knowledge in their brains is strongly interconnected and well-ordered.

> **Paradigm Shift**<br>
> Now, it's not about **'how long you've studied (input quantity)'** but rather **'how orderly you've stored the information (entropy management)'** that determines academic performance.

## 3. [Diagnosis] Check Your Child's Disorder Level

How disordered is their current learning state? Use the checklist below to determine their invisible 'learning entropy' score.

### 📋 Learning Entropy Self-Diagnosis Checklist

- [ ] **Unable to Explain**: Can't explain what was just learned after closing the book.
- [ ] **Delayed Start**: Spends more than 10 minutes doing other things before starting to study.
- [ ] **Searching for Items**: Frequently spends time looking for pens, notebooks, or printouts.
- [ ] **Metacognitive Error**: Mistakes seeing for knowing, and gets problems wrong despite "understanding" them visually.
- [ ] **Lack of Context**: Memorizes words and formulas but doesn't understand the overall flow of the unit.
- [ ] **Chronic Anxiety**: Feels anxious if not studying, but can't concentrate even when sitting down to study.
- [ ] **Multitasking**: Feels compelled to check notifications immediately when they arrive during study.
- [ ] **Big Plans, Poor Follow-Through**: Makes grand plans but can't stick to them for more than three days.
- [ ] **Unable to Apply**: Can solve textbook problems but can't even attempt application problems.
- [ ] **Burnout**: Feels like their mind is empty after exams and lacks motivation.

### 📊 Diagnosis Results

> **0-2 items (Stable: Low Entropy)**<br>
> Highly efficient. Knowledge is systematically organized. Maintain this flow and try to increase your pace.

> **3-6 items (Caution: Medium Entropy)**<br>
> You're working hard, but efficiency is low. Disorder is subtly creeping in. If you don't organize now, it will soon become critical.

> **7+ items (Critical: High Entropy)**<br>
> This is an emergency. The brain is already in a state of chaos. Spending more time is like 'pouring water into a bottomless pit.' Begin by 'emptying and organizing' first.
