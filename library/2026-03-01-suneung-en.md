**[Special Report] From Keyword Queries to Generative Responses: Navigating the Shift in How We Consume Knowledge**

The manner in which humanity consumes information has evolved in tandem with technological progress. If the popularization of web browsers in the 1990s opened the "ocean of information," the emergence of search engines in the 2000s, exemplified by Google, served as "signposts" that indexed vast amounts of data to guide users to the location of necessary information. However, with the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the era of the "Search Engine"—which merely pointed to where information resided—is fading, giving way to the era of the "Answer Engine," which provides refined conclusions instantaneously.

Traditional search methods functioned by listing relevant webpages based on keywords entered by the user. In this model, users had to click on various links, verify the content, and undergo a process of selecting and synthesizing the necessary information themselves. This process allowed significant room for the user’s autonomous judgment and information-seeking capabilities to intervene. In contrast, modern platforms such as Perplexity or OpenAI’s SearchGPT utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to aggregate real-time web information and provide answers in the form of complete, structured sentences. Users no longer need to wander through multiple websites; they obtain organized information through a single inquiry.

While this shift maximizes the efficiency of information consumption, it simultaneously harbors serious structural concerns. The primary issue raised is the contraction of the content ecosystem due to the intensification of the "zero-click" phenomenon. In the traditional search environment, search engines acted as gateways that directed users to websites, which translated into advertising revenue or subscriptions for content creators. However, when AI learns from and summarizes original content to provide direct answers, users lose the incentive to visit the original source sites. This could collapse the revenue models of news organizations and creators who produce high-quality information, potentially leading to a state of "data starvation" where the very source of data for AI to learn from becomes exhausted.

Furthermore, concerns regarding cognitive aspects are non-negligible. While acquiring information in the search engine era was a process of "exploration and verification," it is transforming into a process of "acceptance and trust" in the answer engine era. The responses provided by AI are characterized by smooth prose and logical structures, making it difficult for users to doubt their veracity. If an AI derives conclusions based on biased data or exhibits "hallucinations"—stating falsehoods as if they were facts—there is a high risk that users will accept them without critical thinking. This is why critics point out that the convenience of information could lead to cognitive laziness.

Ultimately, the paradigm shift toward "Answer Engines" is an irreversible trend. However, the convenience of technology must not undermine the sustainability of the information ecosystem. AI companies must establish revenue-sharing models that provide fair compensation to content creators, and users must cultivate critical literacy to verify the underlying evidence rather than blindly relying on the "correct answers" presented by AI. To ensure that the end of search does not result in the end of intellect, we stand at a point where we must find a new equilibrium between information technology and human reasoning.
