**[Analysis] The Rise of AI Agents: The End of Personal Computing as We Know It?**

For several decades, the relationship between humans and computers has remained within a binary framework of "command" and "execution." Users manually operated software and manipulated interfaces to achieve specific objectives. However, the recent emergence of "AI Agents" based on Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally shaking this paradigm. Technology is now evolving beyond mere reactive tools into active subjects capable of independent judgment and execution.

The decisive difference between AI agents and traditional chatbots lies in "autonomy" and "executability." While conventional chatbots are limited to retrieving information to answer questions, agents understand a user's high-level goals and independently establish sub-tasks to achieve them. For instance, in response to the command "Book a trip to Jeju Island this weekend," an agent considers the user’s preferences and budget to search for flights, reserve hotels, and even process payments for car rentals. This is made possible by Large Action Models (LAMs), which recognize and manipulate operating system (OS) or application interfaces just as a human would.

This shift is creating massive ripples across the entire industrial ecosystem, most notably impacting the "app economy." Until now, companies have employed "walled garden" strategies to keep users within their specific apps. However, as AI agents begin to manage all interfaces collectively, the significance of individual apps will likely fade. Users will no longer need to navigate through dozens of separate apps; instead, they will consume all digital services through a single gateway: the agent. This implies that competition among platform giants is shifting from the number of apps to the "intelligence" of the agent itself.

Yet, behind this technological progress lie significant challenges that must be addressed. The first is security and privacy. For an agent to handle payments and personal information on behalf of a user, it must access almost all of that user's data. Any data breach or abuse of authority in this process could pose a threat far more severe than traditional hacking. The second issue is the locus of responsibility. When an AI agent makes a mistake in a reservation or an incorrect financial transaction, legal and ethical standards remain ambiguous as to whether the fault lies with the developer, the model’s error, or the user who gave the final approval.

Ultimately, the advent of the AI agent era demands a "redesign of control" from humans. In exchange for the technology reducing our physical and mental labor, we will likely yield a significant portion of our decision-making authority. While this promises a leap in productivity, it also carries the risk of deteriorating human judgment or becoming trapped in algorithmic biases. We must now ask how we will domesticate this clever assistant. Critical reflection is essential to ensure that the evolution of tools does not lead to human alienation.
