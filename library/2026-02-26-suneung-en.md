Recently, the most debated topic in the global industry is undoubtedly "AI semiconductors." The generative AI craze, triggered by ChatGPT, is moving beyond mere software advancements to cause a seismic shift in the semiconductor market, the underlying hardware that supports it. Particularly, the dominance of NVIDIA, which occupies more than 80% of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) market, has driven its market capitalization to a level unprecedented in the history of capitalism. However, cracks have begun to appear in this monopolistic structure, as "Big Tech" companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Apple are accelerating the development of their own chips to reduce their heavy reliance on NVIDIA.

In the past, while the Central Processing Unit (CPU) served as the brain of the computer by focusing on processing instructions sequentially, semiconductors in the AI era require "parallel computing" capabilities to process vast amounts of data simultaneously. Although NVIDIA’s GPUs were originally designed for graphic tasks, they have become the market standard because their characteristic of having thousands of cores performing calculations at the same time proved to be optimal for AI learning. Furthermore, "CUDA," the software platform built by NVIDIA, has formed a powerful barrier to entry by inducing developers to write code optimized specifically for NVIDIA chips.

However, NVIDIA’s dominance has presented two major challenges to consumers: astronomical costs and supply uncertainty. As AI models grow larger, the number of chips required increases exponentially, making the indefinite purchase of NVIDIA chips—which can cost tens of thousands of dollars per unit—a significant financial burden even for giant corporations. Consequently, Big Tech companies are turning their attention to the development of Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are custom semiconductors optimized for specific purposes. Their strategy is to increase efficiency and lower costs by designing chips specialized only for their own AI algorithms rather than focusing on general-purpose versatility.

This semiconductor war is a matter directly linked to the Korean economy as well. To maximize the performance of AI semiconductors, High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), which can rapidly supply data next to the computing device, is essential. Currently, Korea’s SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics are leading this HBM market, playing the role of a core supply chain for global AI infrastructure. Ultimately, the AI semiconductor war is expanding into a complex ecosystem battle involving not only design (fabless) companies but also foundries (contract manufacturing) and memory semiconductor companies.

Experts predict that the future AI semiconductor market will be reorganized into a bifurcated structure: the advancement of general-purpose chips and the proliferation of custom chips. While NVIDIA strives to maintain its overwhelming hardware performance and software ecosystem, Big Tech will seek hardware independence based on their software technological prowess. At this massive technological inflection point, the key to determining victory or defeat will ultimately depend on who can process more data with less power—that is, who will first overcome the limits of the "performance-per-watt" ratio. Hegemony in the AI era is now being decided beyond simple algorithm competition, moving onto the semiconductor blueprints, the "magic on sand" that actually drives those algorithms.
